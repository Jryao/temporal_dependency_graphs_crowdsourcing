February 29 , 2008
Wikileaks has claimed in a press release that the Swiss bank , Bank Julius Baer & Trust , has abused the system by involving an administrator of the Wikileaks group on Facebook in the court case which has recently lead to a court injunction causing wikileaks.org DNS entry to be removed .
As of this writing , Wikileaks could still be accessed via its IP address at <nowiki> http://88.80.13.160/wiki/wikileaks </nowiki> .
The Facebook user who became involved in the court case has responded to this by saying that `` I am an officer of a Facebook group , which is essentially a message board for discussion of issues relating to Wikileaks .
I am not , and never have been , an officer of Wikileaks , and I request you -LSB- Bank Julius Baer & Trust -RSB- not to represent that I am . ''
Bank Julius Baer & Trust 's law firm said that `` as an officer of a defendant in this action , my client -LSB- Bank Julius Baer & Trust -RSB- is entitled to serve you -LSB- the Facebook User -RSB- a copy of the summons and complaint pursuant . ''
In a different press release , Wikileaks stated that they were not sure of the authenticity of the documents from Bank Julius Baer & Trust until the court case started .
They say that the bank `` in attempting to shoot the messenger has only succeeded , spectacularly , in shooting itself . ''
The injunction , which a Wikileaks user describes as ` blind ' and ` unlawful ' was granted in the California Northern District Court in San Francisco , California .
The case was regarding several documents allegedly obtained from a whistleblower of the Bank Julius Baer & Trust .

June 17 , 2008
Governor Bobby Jindal , a Republican politician from the U.S. state of Louisiana , appeared on CBS 's Face the Nation on Sunday and said he supports teaching intelligent design -LRB- ID -RRB- in public school as `` the very best science . ''
Jindal , who was elected governor in 2007 , is a Hindu convert to Catholicism who takes the Bible literally .
In his exchange on the Sunday morning talk show , `` Some want only to teach intelligent design , some only want to teach evolution .
I think both views are wrong , as a parent . ''
In a September 2007 debate he supported the view of creationism saying , `` Personally , it certainly makes sense to me that when you look at creation , you would believe in a creator . ''
Recently , the Louisiana House of Representatives passed legislation , which the National Center for Science Education said `` opens the door to creationism in public school science classes . ''
The bill is currently on his desk .
Jindal is currently considered a possible Vice President candidate for John McCain 's U.S. Presidential campaign .

June 26 , 2005
The median house price in the United States plunged 6.5 % in May to $ 217,000 .
In February of 2005 , the median price of a home was $ 237,300 .
`` The Economist '' newspaper said in its June 16th issue ; `` In other words , it looks like the biggest bubble in history . ''
by way of reference to what is happening with housing prices in the USA and much of Europe .
Japan provides an example of how a boom can turn to bust .
Property prices have dropped for 14 years in a row -LRB- 40 % from their peak in 1991 -RRB- ; and yet , the rise in prices in Japan during the decade before 1991 was less than the increase over the past ten years in most of today 's `` housing boom '' countries .
The total value of residential property rose by more than $ 30 trillion over the past five years in developed economies , an increase equivalent to 100 % of the combined GDPs of those countries .
This increase dwarfs all previous house-price booms and is greater than the global stockmarket bubble in the late 1990s .
Much of the recent housing activity is being driven by speculative demand .
The National Association of Realtors -LRB- NAR -RRB- reported that 23 % of all American houses bought in 2004 were for investment , not for owners to live in .
Another 13 % were bought as second homes .
NAR also found that 42 % of all first-time buyers made no down-payment on their home purchase last year .
Many investors are buying solely because they think prices will keep rising , which is a warning sign of a financial bubble .
In Miami , Florida , as many as half of the original buyers resell new apartments even before they are built , and properties can change hands two or three times before somebody finally moves in .
Britain 's Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors -LRB- RICS -RRB- reported prices have been falling for ten consecutive months .
Forty nine percent of their surveyors reported falling prices in May .
This was the weakest report since 1992 during Britain 's previous house-price bust .

June 16 , 2009
Today , the Yemeni embassy in the United States announced that Yemeni troops and air support had been dispatched to search for six missing hostages , after three bodies were found on Saturday .
Reports suggest that the group of nine were having a picnic on Friday when they were abducted in the Saada province of Yemen .
The three bodies discovered were those of a South Korean teacher and two German nurses .
The missing six are believed to consist of five Germans , of whom three are children and a Briton .
A spokesman for the Yemeni Embassy said '' -LSB- The foreigners -RSB- ventured outside the city of Saada without the required police escorts due to the heightened security situation in the area .
This event was a heinous crime and constitutes not only a violation against the peaceful principles of Islam , but also the precepts of humanity . ''
It is currently unknown who is responsible for the kidnapping , with both Shiite rebels and drugs cartels being accused .
Yemen has suffered a string of kidnappings , normally of foreigners , although to date all were released unharmed .
This would be the first instance first year of hostages being killed .

June 28 , 2005
In accordance with the Treaty on Open Skies , Norway and Denmark started conducting observation flights over Belarus and Russia yesterday .
These flights are expected to last until July 1 , with seven Belarusian and two Russian inspectors monitoring foreign planes .
The treaty establishes a program of unarmed aerial surveillance flights over the entire territory of its 34 state participants .
The treaty is designed to enhance mutual understanding and confidence by giving all participants , regardless of size , a direct role in gathering information about military forces and activities of concern to them .

July 16 , 2005
At a U.S. House Armed Services Committee meeting broadcast on `` CSPAN '' , former CIA Director Woolsey talked about the 18.5 billion dollar bid by the government-backed China National Offshore Oil Corporation -LRB- CNOOC -RRB- for the purchase of Unocal Corporation .
He said this is definitely a strategic energy power move by China , and it was not for economic gain .
Others are still worried about EMP .
U.S. Treasury Secretary John Snow heads a committee that can block the takeover .
The U.S. House of Representatives passed a measure in June by a wide margin to form the committee under Snow .
U.S. national security concerns are at stake according to analysts and many conservatives .
The United States reluctance to allow China 's unsolicited bid for an American oil company surprises some .
When Russia claimed their own oil companies could not be bought by Americans for both `` strategic '' and `` national security '' reasons , the United States was vehemently opposed to that position .

December 6 , 2004
Former Houston Rockets star Calvin Murphy , accused of molestation by five of daughters , was found not guilty by the jury , putting an end to the eight-month long trial .
The alleged incidents took place more than ten years ago , when the daughters , who are now grown , ranged in age from 6 to 16 .
They accused Murphy of fondling them and performing oral sex on them .
Murphy has 14 children by nine women .
Murphy 's attorney claimed that the women 's accusations were false and that they were bitter because he did not treat them the same as he treated the children born to his ex-wife .
Murphy 's two daughters who were products of his previous marriage came to his defense .
The jury indicated that they found the women 's statements unreliable .
The former basketball star 's lawyers said three of the five daughters had been trying to claim $ 52,408 in death benefits left in a teachers retirement account belonging to their mother , Phyllis Davidson .
Murphy had a 20-year relationship and four children with Davidson , who died in a car accident in 1996 .
This year , the three daughters continued their grandmother 's attempt to stop Murphy from receiving the benefits .
He was listed as the account 's beneficiary , according to court records .
On Feb. 20 , letters went to Murphy , his three daughters and their grandmother that Murphy was the account 's rightful beneficiary .
The money was never paid .
A month later , Murphy was arrested and charged with sexual abuse and indecency .
Because of the nature of the accusations , Murphy lost his job with the Houston Rockets , where he was a TV commentator .
Murphy has not commented about if he has plans to return to a broadcasting career .

November 3 , 2010
A British Columbia company NuCaptcha launched a video-based animated CAPTCHA service to test whether users are humans or robots .
As the company says , it is easier to recognise for humans and more difficult to decipher .
Many companies supply the users of the service with video and text of advertising content , since the image is what the users have to view to proceed with the service they 're using .
According to NuCaptcha , the moving image does n't need to be as clear as static images .
With a random video background and big-sized moving text , the blurred text turned out to be easier to be recognized by the brain .
The researchers say same text is n't that easily recongised when it 's static .
Therefore , the image is more complicated to process or abuse , while still being easily readable , NuCaptcha says .
The image , as most modern videos , has a significantly bigger size than previously used static images .
If often opens in a popup window .
The bigger size improves accessibility .
As news reporters say , the CAPTCHAs are now easy to use even for older people with vision impairments .
The website administrators have to get a database of videos and text material for use with the new technology .
In reaction to this demand , a number of companies supply the webmasters with advertising videos for use as the text background .
The Captchas need full attention of the user to solve .
The ads are also not blocked incidentally by security tools like NoScript .
The service is seen as a niche for successful advertising , and is favored by advertisement providers along with the webmasters .
Electronic Arts , Activision and Disney are among the current list of companies which give out the videos and text for NuCaptcha .

Police apprehended the suspect near the scene .
According to the Aiken County Sheriff 's Office , Ricky New entered the store carrying a large stick , demanded money , assaulted the clerk with the stick , and left with an undisclosed amount of money .

September 17 , 2005
A court has freed prominent Malawian politician Gwanda Chakuamba on bail after Chakuamba denied ridiculing Malawi president Bingu wa Mutharika at a political rally .
Ridiculing the head of state is a crime in Malawi , with a potential penalty ranging from a $ 20 fine to three years in prison .
Prosecutor Mcleod Mlonda objected to the ruling , stating that he was worried that as Chakuamba was an influential figure , he would use his freedom to tamper with the evidence .
Magistrate David Kadwa disagreed though , stating that he found it unlikely that Chakuamba would be able to interfere with the evidence , as there had been hundreds of witnesses present when the alleged comments were made .
For his part , Chakuamba has denied the charges .
Chakuamba was ejected from Malawi 's cabinet for allegedly buying a limousine with government funds last week , amid rumours of an internal power struggle .
Prosecutors accuse him of labelling the President a `` drunkard and a brute '' .

September 26 , 2005
The American Food and Drug Administration has recalled operational rations -LRB- MREs -RRB- donated by Britain to help survivors of Hurricane Katrina .
The Daily Mirror insinuated that the majority of the 400,000 rations donated by Britain , at a cost of millions of pounds , are set to be destroyed at a plant in Little Rock , Arkansas .
The Washington Times reported , on September 23 , 2005 , that a spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Agriculture confirmed that the food was being held at the facility but denied any plans to incinerate the rations donated by Britain .
Nevertheless , the move has infuriated aid workers who hasten to point out that `` Under NATO , American soldiers are also entitled to eat such rations , yet the starving of the American South will see them go up in smoke because of FDA red tape madness . ''
One aid worker was quoted as saying that `` the world 's richest nation could n't organize a piss-up in a brewery and lets Americans starve while they arrogantly observe petty regulations .
Everyone is revolted by the chaotic shambles the US is making of this crisis .
Guys from UNICEF are walking around spitting blood . ''
An FDA spokesman said the rations had not been inspected but were automatically deemed `` unfit for human consumption '' due to Bovine spongiform encephalopathy -LRB- BSE or colloquially `` mad cow disease '' -RRB- fears .
He observed that 70 pallets of vegetarian MREs were inspected and approved on September 13th .
Aid workers claim that , today , BSE is much more of a problem in the U.S. than in Britain .
Food donations from Spain and Italy are also being held by the FDA due to similar concern , as well as thousands of gallons of pear juice from Israel .
Licensing regulations have also prevented foreign nations from sending doctors and other medical personnel .

October 22 , 2015
Ena Kadić , an Austrian woman who won the 2013 Miss Austria crown , died early this week in hospital .
She was 26 and fell whilst jogging in the Austrian Alps on Friday .
Kadić fell roughly 30m down the Bergisel mountain in Tyrol , near Innsbruck where she worked .
She was taken to Innsbruck University Hospital with injuries to her head , pelvis , and lung .
Remaining conscious after the fall , she had alerted her family via telephone who in turn contacted emergency services .
She was found near the Drachenfelsen platform , which overlooks the River Sill .
Police said she knew the area and enjoyed running ; a profile on the Miss Austria website said she was into sports and nature .
The brown-haired , green-eyed beauty 's looks took her to compete in Bali , Indonesia in 2013 .
Thereafter she shunned publicity and worked in a fashion store .
`` The media , the events , the parties -- that life made me so unhappy , '' she said this year in a Seitenblicke interview .

March 21 , 2016
At least four people were killed by a suicide bomb in the Turkish city of Istanbul on Saturday morning .
The suicide bomber was a fifth death .
At least 36 people were injured , according to Turkish health minister Mehmet Müezzinoğlu .
Reports varied on how may injured were foreigners ; Minister Müezzinoğlu identified the nationalities of twelve injured from Israel , Germany , Ireland , Iceland , Iran , and Dubai .
The blast occurred prematurely , according to CNN Türk .
The attack took place on Istiklal Street , a popular pedestrian commercial street .
Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu called the blast `` inhumane , '' saying Turkey would continue to fight `` centres of terrorism '' .
This is the third attack in Turkey in just over a month , following a car bomb that killed more than 30 people in Ankara , the capital of Turkey , six days earlier , and the bombing of a military convoy in mid-February .
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey condemned the Ankara attack , saying , `` Terror organisations and their pawns are targeting our innocent citizens in the most immoral and heartless way as they lose the fight against our security forces -LSB- ... -RSB- Terror attacks -- which intend to target the integrity of Turkey , unity and solidarity of our people -- do not diminish our will to fight against terror , but further boost it . ''
The Ankara attack has since been claimed by a Kurdish military group , the Kurdish Freedom Falcons : `` We claim the operation of March 13 , 2016 , at 6:45 p.m. in the heart of the Republic of Turkey '' .
The Kurdish Freedom Falcons are associated with the Kurdistan Workers Party -LRB- PKK -RRB- .
According to Reuters , violence has escalated in southeast of Turkey since the July collapse of the Turkey -- PKK ceasefire .

filename:<doc id="395713" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=395713" title="Roman coins hoard found in Somerset, England"><paragraph:1_2_4_7_9>:SNT_LIST
March 23 , 2012
It has now emerged that in the past four to five years , approximately thirty thousand silver Roman coins were discovered in the city of Bath , in Somerset , England .
Archaeologists discovered the coins , which are thought to date back to the year 270 , on the site of a new hotel on Beau Street in the city as work was underway 150 metres away from the Roman Baths .
The hoard , named as the Beau Street Hoard , is understood to be the fifth largest ever uncovered in the United Kingdom and the greatest one found at a Roman town in the country .
Speaking on behalf of Roman Baths , Stephen Clews stated : `` We 've put in a request for a formal valuation and then hope to buy the coins to display them at the baths .
At the time there was a lot of unrest in the Roman Empire so there may be some explanation for why the coins were hidden away . ''
This discovery was `` unusual as it was discovered by professional archaeologists as opposed to an amateur using a metal detector , '' according to Clews .
The discovered coins were found to be in a large block joined together , increasing the difficulty of establishing what exact kind of coins these are , as well as the total number of them .
The hoard has been sent to the British Museum in the capital London where conservators are anticipated to take twelve months or more to analyse the coins .
The Roman Baths is now attempting to accumulate £ 150,000 -LRB- € 180,000 or US$ 237,000 -RRB- in funding so as to allow them to acquire the coins and place them on display .

February 5 , 2005
London , UK -- The quarterly G7 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors ' meeting at Lancaster House concluded on February 5 , 2005 , with the G7 failing to agree on a plan to reduce debt in developing countries .
According to the Los Angeles Times , British Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown announced that he believes , `` this summit will be remembered as the summit for 100 % debt relief '' for the 27 countries involved in the Enhanced HIPC Initiative .
Ministers from other G7 countries disagreed .
Brown 's so-called International Financial Facility proposal , or IFF , `` would not work for the U.S , '' Undersecretary of the U.S. Treasury John Taylor said to the Los Angeles Times .
The joint statement issued by the ministers in the wake of the conference stated that , `` We are agreed on a case-by-case analysis of HIPC countries , based on our willingness to provide as much as 100 per cent multilateral debt relief . ''
The ministers did not cite a figure for the minimum amount of debt relief that would be provided .
The conference was preceded by a demonstration in Trafalgar Square on the theme of `` Make Poverty History . ''
Nelson Mandela spoke at the demonstration , attended by an estimated 20,000 people , according to World Development Movement , an organization involved in the planning of the event .
Chancellor Brown invited Mandela to address the G7 on February 4 , 2005 , which he did in a `` fireside chat , '' according to Larry Elliott of The Guardian .
The G7 , or ` Group of Seven , ' is a coalition of seven major industrial democracies : the United Kingdom , France , Germany , Italy , Japan , the United States , and Canada .
They hold quarterly meetings to discuss financial matters .

August 18 , 2006
Nearing the one year anniversary of the publication of twelve controversial editorial cartoons depicting Muhammad in a Danish newspaper , a leading authority of Sunni Islam has demanded that the newspaper be shut down .
In an interview with the Danish newspaper Berlingske Tidende , Sheikh Mohammed Sayyed Tantawi , Grand Iman of the Al-Azhar University in Cairo and formerly Grand Mufti of the Republic , demanded the closure of Jyllands Posten , the paper responsible for publishing the cartoons .
He went on to call for chief editor Carsten Juste to be jailed for three years , and for the editor of the paper 's cartoon section , Flemming Rose , be depicted as a pig .
`` It is thought provoking , '' Rose said , `` that he -LRB- Tantawi -RRB- believes it would be a punishment for me to be depicted as a pig .
It confirms that the imam has a shocking lack of knowledge about our civilisation , and it confirms the need for dialogue . ''
Rose added that it shows how blasphemy law in the Arab world is used to suppress those with views different from those in power .
Tantawi called the drawings `` one of the most serious crimes ever committed . ''

February 1 , 2013
The United States economy shrank by 0.1 % in the last three months of 2012 according to official statistics released on Wednesday by the United States Department of Commerce .
The contraction in the economy comes after growth of 3.1 % in the previous quarter -LRB- July to September -RRB- and is the first contraction since the 2009 recession .
Economic growth is thought to have fallen due to cuts in government spending , including a 22 % cut in the defence budget being the largest decline in defence spending since 1972 .
Economic analysts had expected a 1.1 % in growth according to polling conducted by the news agency Reuters and that none of them had predicted a contraction in the economy .
Export levels were at their lowest for almost four years , this may be due to the recession in Europe and a decline in growth in China .
However , there were increases in consumer spending and investments which shows that there may be other problems with the economy and that the `` fiscal cliff '' issues of December did not worry markets too much .

April 9 , 2005
April 9 , 2005 A rise in flesh-eating staph infections has worried doctors about the possible spread of drug resistant bacteria .
Staphylococcus aureus , commonly known as staph , is a bacteria that commonly causes skin infections in otherwise healthy people .
However , as a persistent threat in hospitals , it tends to infect patients who are already sick and whose systems are vulnerable due to IV lines that pierce the skin .
Doctors have already battled for years against drug-resistant strains of the bacteria , but the struggle has generally been confined to hospitals .
Now , however , Methicillin Resistant Staph Aureus -LRB- MRSA -RRB- has been spreading in communities outside hospitals .
Cases have multiplied by 25 times since 1998 at the University of Chicago .
A Los Angeles hospital documented 14 cases of the flesh-eating infection , where patients required substantial time in intensive care and surgery .
The infections are particularly problematic because nearly a quarter of people who get a staph infection require hospitalization .
Staph infections are spread much like other diseases , with crowded conditions , poor hygiene , and skin-to-skin contact most frequently to blame .
At higher risk are prison inmates , homeless people , military personnel , and families with kids in day care .
Athletes also have a higher risk , because sweating makes it easier for bacteria to infect the skin .

August 25 , 2007
Efforts to salvage the Indonesian naval vessel `` Arung Samudera '' from where she ran aground on the Sunshine Coast Queensland , have been delayed due to poor weather conditions .
The 35-metre , tri-masted vessel was originally grounded on August 23 in stormy weather at Inskip Point , near Rainbow Beach .
A salvage contractor has being brought in to rescue the stricken vessel , her hull is intact and it is believed the ship is in no imminent danger of breaking apart .
However , the tall ship did drag its anchors and break its rudder and centreboard during the beaching .
Australian Navy Commander Forbes Peters says that although salvage has been postponed until early next week , the vessel will be surveyed today by the salvage firm .
`` To develop a plan for how they would salvage the vessel of the beach , that 's going to involve a tugboat pulling the thing off the beach with a longline .
`` The trouble with actually conducting the salvage will be the sea state ... Until the weather abates there really will not be able to do much in terms of salvage , '' he said .
The 18-man crew - six officers and 12 sailors - of the New Zealand-built vessel have managed to retrieve their belongings from the ship , and are now expected to be transported to temporary accommodation in local barracks in Bulimba , Brisbane .
It is still hoped the ship can be repaired in time for it to attend a summit next month in Sydney , but this to be unlikely .
A decision on whether to take her to Brisbane or Gladstone for repairs is expected to be made on Monday .

August 26 , 2007
A one-inch settlement of the roof of The Bay tunnel to the Montreal Metro caused authorities to evacuate 12 blocks of the Montreal downtown core .
Several people noticed water infiltration in the tunnel over the last few days .
On Friday , August 24 , at 1 p.m. , while investigating another water infiltration incident , The Bay employees noticed that the ceiling of the tunnel portion of The Bay 's basement sales area had descended one inch over a 7 meter length .
They subsequently called police .
The police and firefighters evacuated the basement of the downtown Bay store .
The police closed de Maisonneuve Boulevard from Aylmer Street to Union Street , over the area of the crack .
At 4 p.m. , firefighters evacuated the Parkade Montreal Building and The Bay Department Store after finding pieces of concrete falling from the Parkade Montreal structure , a multi-story carpark with five levels of offices on top .
They also evacuated the downtown portion of the Line 1 / Green Line of the Montreal Metro subway , from Lionel-Groulx to Berri-UQAM stations , and evacuated the McGill metro station , which is situated below The Bay tunnel .
After consulting with city engineers , Centre 2001 , the loading dock of the Bay and its Hertz car rental agency , Les Promenades Cathedrale underground shopping centre and office tower , and a neighbouring office tower to the Parkade were also evacuated .
Police cordoned off an area from Bleury Street in the east to University Street in the west , and from Ste-Catherine Street in the south to President Kennedy Street to the north .
The closure of the Metro caused havoc to the Friday afternoon rush hour , as over 40,000 people regularly use the Green Line -LRB- Line 1 -RRB- every day .
Montreal Transit Corporation workers issued directions during the day , though some may not have been informed of a provisionary bus service to replace the lost subway service .
Loudspeakers announced that commuters should use the unaffected Orange Line -LRB- Line 2 -RRB- , which has lines between 5 and 10 blocks south of Line 1 -LRB- Green Line -RRB- , and also connects to Lionel-Groulx and Berri-UQAM stations .
The downtown area is intended to remain closed for at least the weekend , along with portions of the underground city , or RESO .
The tunnel was built in 1966 .
For the last few days , city work crews have been working above the slab in question , digging a one meter trench to install a median and segregate a new bike path on de Maisonneuve Boulevard .
The tunnel roof lies five meters below street level .
Residents of Montreal are frustrated with the crumbling infrastructure in and around the city , including the collapse of the de la Concorde Boulevard overpass over Autoroute 19 expressway last year , the shattering of a column holding up the Autoroute 720 Ville Marie elevated expressway last month , and other incidents .

August 26 , 2007
The huge forest fires that blazed across southern Greece on Friday and Saturday were stabilized for a few hours today .
Fire Brigade Officer Nikos Tsogas said , `` It 's not getting worse ... we have to act fast because the winds might pick up . ''
However , the winds have reportedly intensified .
Fire department spokesman Nikos Diamandis said , `` Unfortunately the improvement that we were looking for is not there ... Our target is for the fire not to enter Ancient Olympia , not to destroy antiquities . ''
Fire is surrounding villages just a few miles away from Ancient Olympia .
Several new fires also broke out today in Phiotida in central Greece .
The worst fires continue to burn in the southern mountains of Peloponnese , where some blazes involve 42 major fronts .
The fires have killed at least 63 people .
Some reports indicate that an unspecified number are also missing .

August 26 , 2007
The Canadian government , through Health Canada , has issued an additional warning to Canadians not to use `` Neem Active Toothpaste with Calcium '' , as testing revealed the presence of high levels of harmful bacteria .
The same brand of toothpaste was subject to a recall July 26 , 2007 when it was found to contain unacceptable levels of diethylene glycol -LRB- DEG -RRB- .
Health Canada has advised Canadians to discontinue use of the toothpaste , which is manufactured by Calcutta Chemical Co. Ltd. in India , and keep it out of the reach of children .
The toothpaste is not approved for sale in Canada , but has been found in stores across the country .
Although the species of bacteria found was not revealed by Health Canada , they described possible adverse effects such as `` fever , urinary tract infection , and gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting , diarrhea and abdominal pain . ''
A specific warning focused on particularly vulnerable groups ; infants , children and hospitalised patients with compromised immune systems .
This current warning from Health Canada follows a similar recall of toothpaste from China , including some counterfeit Colgate brands , which were found to contain DEG and high levels of harmful bacteria .
To obtain more information on the most recent warning , consumers are advised to call Health Canada 's public enquiries line at 1-866-225-0709 .

August 26 , 2007
Investigators have discovered a hole in the fuel tank of the China Airlines jet that caught fire and exploded on August 20 on the island of Okinawa , Japan .
Investigators from Japan , Taiwan and the United States have all been examining the wreckage of China Airlines Flight 120 since the accident .
Now , Japanese investigators say that they have found that a structural bolt had pierced the fuel tank of the Boeing 737-800 series aircraft .
`` We spotted a hole in a fuel tank , '' said a brief statement by the transport ministry 's investigative division .
`` We suspect that oil leaked from this hole and spilled from the right wing to the outside . ''
It is understood that , prior to the discovery of the hole , the investigation had been focusing on the tubing connecting the fuel tank to the engine , rather than the tank itself .
Taiwan-based China Airlines 's only comment was to repeat earlier comments that the plane had been inspected last month , at which point the airline had been unable to find any problem with it .
However , prior to this news , the chief executive flew to Okinawa to console worried tourists , while chairman Philip Wei offered to resign '' ... in a bid to shoulder his responsibility , '' , according to an airline official .
The airline is also offering compensation to passengers on the flight .
Boeing refused to comment on the incident , citing the fact that the investigation remains open .
However , the `` Jiji Press '' has reported that Boeing had warned airlines in 2006 about the possibility of bolts piercing the fuel tanks , after a number of incidents in which tank piercing was found to have occurred .

The announcement was made by the nation 's military in a statement , saying that the air-launched Ra'ad -LRB- meaning ` thunder ' in Arabic -RRB- missile has been successfully tested .

August 28 , 2007
Sen. Larry Craig held a news conference Tuesday in Boise , Idaho to issue a public statement about his arrest in June , 2007 and subsequent guilty plea , August 8 , to a misdemeanor charge of disorderly conduct .
In his statement , Sen. Craig indicated that when he pled guilty to the charge , two months after the fact , he did n't understand at the time what he was signing and declared himself innocent of any wrongdoing at the Minneapolis airport on June 11 , 2007 .
According to the arresting officer , Sgt. Dave Karsnia , who was dressed in civilian clothes at the time of the incident , he was using a bathroom stall when Sen. Craig entered the stall next to his .
Karsnia reported the Senator tapped his right foot , and then stretched his foot over to touch the officer 's left foot .
Sen. Craig also ran his hand along the bottom of the stall 's dividing wall .
According to CNN , that type of behavior is known in the Gay community as a signal that the person wants to engage in lewd behavior .
The officer subsequently showed Sen. Craig his badge .
Using his other hand , Karsnia directed Craig to move toward the door .
After some words and Sen. Craig 's refusal to cooperate with the officer , he was placed under arrest .
An additional charge against Sen. Craig , interference with privacy , had been thrown out .
Sen. Craig received a ten-day suspended jail sentence , was fined US$ 500 , and was given one year probation .
Sen. Craig admitted that he did not mention his arrest to the Senate Ethics Committee , which is not required by law , and also did n't tell his wife and other immediate family members about his arrest until recent days .

August 30 , 2007
Talks aimed at negotiating peace between Iraqi Shi'ites and Sunni Muslims , the two largest population groups in Iraq , are set to take place in Finland within the next few days .
The Crisis Management Initiative -LRB- CMI -RRB- and the Finnish Foreign Ministry have both confirmed reports that the pre-arranged talks are scheduled to begin soon in an undisclosed location in Finland .
The CMI , a non-governmental organisation founded by former President of Finland Martti Ahtisaari , has organised the talks , which are said to include key politicians , including representatives of major political parties .
Although the CMI will host the talks , Finland will take no direct role in the discussions .
Martti Ahtisaari specifically will not take part , either .
All of those to take part in the mediations are still to arrive in Finland , including mediators from Northern Ireland and South Africa , who have already negotiated successful peace deals in their own countries .
The CMI has already succeeded once in helping two rival factions come to a peace deal .
In 2005 , the organisation arranged successful talks between the Indonesian government and the Free Aceh Movement .

August 12 , 2013
South African President Jacob Zuma announced yesterday that the health of former President and anti-apartheid campaigner Nelson Mandela was showing a `` slow but steady improvement '' .
The 95-year-old was admitted to hospital on June 8 with a lung infection .
Zuma 's statement mirrors that of Mandela 's youngest daughter Zindzi who told the state-owned television company SABC on Friday that Mandela `` now manages to sit up , like now he is able to sit up in a chair for a few minutes in a day .
Every day you know , he is becoming more alert , more responsive and so on . ''
Zindzi was confident in her father 's recovery : '' -LSB- He -RSB- is determined not to go anywhere anytime soon .
I can not stress this enough .
People must stop saying to the family ` let go , let go ' .
We are just looking at this man who is saying ` I 'm not going anywhere ' . ''
According to legal documents filed by Mandela 's family , he was at one stage on life support .
All vehicles entering the hospital in Pretoria where Mandela is being treated are being searched by police officers .
Well-wishers have left messages and flowers for Mandela .

filename:<doc id="8514" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=8514" title="Radioactive soil from Maine reactor refused at landfill in Utah"><paragraph:1_4_6>:SNT_LIST
April 22 , 2005
Envirocare , a corporation that runs a landfill in Utah that accepts radioactive waste , has turned away a shipment of soil from around the Maine Yankee nuclear power plant in Wiscasset , Maine , the `` Portland Press Herald '' reported .
The soil , which is held in 48 boxcars , was contaminated during the 26 years during which the Maine Yankee plant generated electricity .
The shipment was refused due to excess water in previous shipments .
The plant stopped producing electricity in 1997 ; its concrete dome was detonated in September of 2004 .
The decommissioning is scheduled for completion by the summer of 2005 .
In a related development , a Wiscasset environmental organization , the Chewonki Foundation , has taken possession of a 200 acre portion of the former power plant 's lands ; the Foundation will act as stewards of the land , according to the `` Wiscasset Newspaper '' .
The plot , known as Eaton Farm for its previous agricultural use , will be the site of what Chewonki Foundation Executive Director W. Donald Hudson , Ph.D. , calls , `` the coolest trail in the state of Maine . ''
The five miles of trail on the Eaton Farm land will be part of a 12 mile trail that may eventually run from downtown Wiscasset to Montsweag Bay .

August 27 , 2007
Fires continue to burn in Greece on Monday destroying everything in their path .
Death toll has exceeded 60 with daily Greek newspapers `` Kathimerini '' and `` Ta Nea '' reporting 61 and 63 deaths respectively .
Ancient Olympia , birthplace of the Olympics , was also threatened but firefighters kept the site safe .
The new museum of Olympia was saved in the last minute but part of the ancient stadium was not spared .
The Greek Government has offered a € 1 million reward for anyone providing information which leads to the arrest of an arsonist .
A Greek government statement read : `` The reward is set between 100,000 and 1m euros for every -LSB- act -RSB- of arson , depending on whether death or serious injury occurred and the size of the damage . ''
The Greek government is under severe criticism for not doing enough to combat the raging fires .
Greek newspaper `` Ta Nea '' is reporting that the government is facing collapse accusing it of lacking an organized plan to combat the fires .
It adds that there are tens of reports resulting from witnesses that demonstrate the ad hoc movement of fire fighting forces but also tragically , an absence of a plan for evacuating villages resulting in the unnecessarily increased death toll .
Emergency workers and fire-fighting planes from other European Union countries have joined the battle against the fires , and more help is expected from countries outside the EU .

August 29 , 2007
Celtic headed into this match knowing a goal would send them into the group stages .
Celtic started well when Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink shouldered Shunsuke Nakamura 's cross over the bar after ten minutes .
If the Dutchman had 've been more precise Celtic could 've controlled the game from the start .
Five minutes later Scott McDonald played a one-two with Vennegoor of Hesselink who played a good short ball back which fell right for McDonald 's left foot but he agonisingly hit wide .
It was n't all Celtic though .
Spartak Moscow counter-attacked brilliantly and nearly scored 17 minuted in .
Artur Boruc made a last-ditch save and Lee Naylor cleared after Vladimir Bystrov cut the ball back to Dmitri Torbinsky just outside the box .
Just 60 seconds later Aiden McGeady hit a good shot wide of the Moscow goal .
Then 25 minutes in , the referee made the worst decision of the match .
Welliton , the Brazilian striker , shot straight at Artur Boruc and the ball bounced off him and hit Gary Caldwell 's grounded hand .
The referee gave the penalty .
There was nowhere for Caldwell to go and the penalty should not have been given .
However Pavlyuchenko 's penalty hit the post .
2 minutes later Celtic showed no signs of giving up .
Scott McDonald scored his first Celtic goal after Massimo Donati 's shot deflected off a defender and fell for McDonald on his stronger right foot .
He slotted it straight past the keeper to give Celtic a 1-0 lead .
35 minutes into the match , Bystrov , who 'd been causing Celtic , mainly Lee Naylor , many problems , sprinted past Lee Naylor again and if it was n't for captain Stephen McManus blocking the shot , it could 've been 1-1 .
Just before half time Spartak scored from a corner after scrappy Celtic defending .
Vennegoor of Hesselink and Mark Wilson could n't clear the ball and Pavlyuchenko , who missed a penalty earlier , controlled and slotted the ball past a very angry Artur Boruc .
In first half stoppage time , Bystrov powered down the left wing and Naylor gave away another corner , luckily though the referee blew his whistle .
But that did n't stop Artur Boruc from going over to Lee Naylor and shouting at him .
Lee Naylor hit back and if it was n't for Caldwell and McGeady breaking it up they could 've both been sent off .
The second half started as lively as the first .
Vennegoor of Hesselink was being held in the box in the 51st minute but no penalty was given .
The next big chance was when the ball fell for Vennegoor of Hesselink in the 65th minute , he turned and dragged a point-blank shot wide .
From the 77th minute onwards the game started to open up with McDonald and Vennegoor of Hesselink having two great chances before Nakamura had three chances in two minutes .
In the 84th minute Nakamura had a chance to score a free-kick after Vennegoor of Hesselink was taken down by Martin Stranzl , 21 yards out from goal .
Stranzl was then sent off by the referee and Spartak Moscow were left with ten men for the remainder of the match .
Unfortunately Nakamura 's free-kick hit McDonald as it made it 's way toward the goal .
Celtic and Spartak both had chances before the full time whistle went .
Celtic were very attacking from the start of extra time .
The man advantage seemed to be helping Celtic as McDonald and Vennegoor of Hesselink both missed good chances in the first five minutes .
In the 99th minute Aiden McGeady made a good run down the right wing to find nobody in the box .
Forced to make a shot , it ended it up going off for a throw in .
Just before extra time half time Derek Riordan , who replaced McGeady , picked up the ball and slammed a brilliant shot just a yard wide on his European début .
Five minutes into the second half of extra time , Maksym Kalynychenko hit a superb shot which Boruc got a vital touch to .
The ball then went straight down to the Spartak box but Vennegoor of Hesselink could only hit into Stipe Pletikosa 's hands .
In the 24th minute , Celtic were gifted a penalty after Scott Brown 's power shot struck Radoslav Kováč 's arm .
Vennegoor smashed the penalty into the bar .
Six minutes later the referee blew the whistle .
The match was going to penalties .
