October 29 , 2012
The Bremer Freimarkt -LRB- Free Fair -RRB- -- historically one of the oldest fairs in Germany -- has its greatest event with the Free Fair Procession `` Freimarktsumzug '' ; this year 's Freimarktsumzug took place Saturday .
The procession started Saturday morning on the opposite side of the river Weser in the `` Neustadt '' and passed the city hall about one hour later .
146 colorfully decorated groups were taking part , some of them dancing to their own music , and were watched by about 200.000 people in the streets during more than four hours of the whole performance .
The event could also be viewed on television and on livestream on the web .
The Free Fair opened on the place behind the main station of the city of Bremen a week ago .
The origin of this popular event can be traced back to the year 1035 .
Nowadays it has been called the `` biggest Fairground Festival in northern Germany '' .
For a few years , an historical spectacle involving actors of the theatre group `` Shakespeare Company '' has been part of the opening performance of the fair .
With a replica of an old cog an ambassador enters the banks of the river Weser close to the city and walks with his companions to the market place in front of the city hall of Bremen where the Kleiner Freimarkt -LRB- `` Small Free Fair '' -RRB- is opened .
Members of the Chimney Sweep Guild hang up a big heart at the statue of Roland as a sign of the opened market .
The traditional opening takes place in the Bavarian tent on the Bürgerweide behind the main station of Bremen with the tapping of the first keg by the incumbent Senator of the Interior of the Free Hansetown of Bremen .
This is followed by the dance with Miss Free Market on the stage .
Late at night , also fireworks are lighted over the place Bürgerweide and can be admired by people .
The exclamation `` Ischa Freimaak '' -LRB- It 's Free Fair -RRB- is meant to spread a relaxed and unreserved atmosphere among the guests .
The fair is a major source of revenue for showmen , carousels and food stalls , some of which arrived nearly two weeks before the opening from all over Germany .
This year the Freimarkt is to last until Sunday November 4 .
The subsequent disassembly , especially the technically complex rides , should then take about ten days .

filename:<doc id="614292" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=614292" title="Hillary Clinton condemns violence in Northern Ireland"><paragraph:1_3_5_6_7_9_11_13_14_17>:SNT_LIST
December 8 , 2012
United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has called yesterday -LRB- Friday -RRB- for an end to violence which has taken place in Northern Ireland this week , following the decision of Belfast City Council to stop flying the Union Flag year round .
Clinton , who was on a visit to Belfast as part of a four-day tour of Europe , said that violence `` is never an acceptable response to disagreements . ''
At a press conference also attended by Northern Ireland First Minister Peter Robinson and Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness , Clinton condemned the violence : `` We have seen this week the work is not complete and I join in condemning the recent attacks , '' she said .
She also called for all Northern Ireland parties `` to confront the remaining challenge of sectarian divisions , peacefully together '' .
She said that even though peace in Northern Ireland was `` remarkably durable '' , `` there are still those who would try to destroy it . ''
Even though Clinton will be stepping down as Secretary of State next month , she pledged to continue working on the peace process in Northern Ireland , `` I offer to you , as I stand down from Secretary of State , to continue working with you in developing the peace process as an advocate and cheerleader for the process and to reach out to those who are not feeling part of it . ''
This week 's outbreak of violence in Northern Ireland followed the decision by Belfast City Council to only fly the Union Flag on certain designated days , instead of all-year round , as is currently the case .
Although nationalists on the council had wanted the flag removed completely , Alliance persuaded them to vote for their compromise proposal , whereby the flag would only be flown on certain designated days per year .
Alliance MP for East Belfast Naomi Long has received death threats , which Clinton called `` unacceptable '' .
A Carrickfergus Alliance party office was set on fire and two Bangor councillors ' homes were attacked .
Hillary Clinton and her husband Bill Clinton have visited Northern Ireland several times previously .
Bill Clinton played a key part in convincing both sides in the conflict to agree to end the violence .
Since becoming Secretary of State in 2008 , Clinton has visited over 100 countries , meaning she has visited more countries during her tenure than any other Secretary of State .
There is now speculation as to whether Clinton will launch another presidential bid , following her failed campaign in 2008 , when she was beaten to the Democratic Party nomination by Barack Obama .
Several international figures have said they would support her presidential candidacy , including former UK prime minister Tony Blair , and Jordanian minister Nasser Judeh .
57 % of those polled in a recent survey by the Washington Post indicated that they would support Clinton 's candidacy although she has denied that she is planning to run .
Clinton is now to continue her tour of Europe , which is expected to be one of her last foreign trips as Secretary of State , with visits to the Czech Republic and Belgium .

filename:<doc id="673095" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=673095" title="Two Outer Hebrides councillors launch petition to retain local flight services"><paragraph:1_2_7_10_14_17>:SNT_LIST
February 17 , 2013
In the Outer Hebrides of Scotland , two councillors from the Scottish National Party -LRB- SNP -RRB- began a petition Friday , the day after Comhairle nan Eilean Siar -- the local government council for the Western Isles -- said it would discontinue flight services between the islands of Benbecula and Barra as part of its 2013 / 2014 budget .
The petition -- entitled `` To petition the Scottish Parliament that Comhairle nan Eilean Siar maintains its support for the lifeline air services between Stornoway , Benbecula and Barra '' -- has also been launched in response to another council decision to restrict flight services between the islands of Benbecula and Lewis to three days a week , although the move has been temporarily suspended for two weeks to allow for NHS Western Isles to provide funding for said services .
Otherwise , the changes come into effect late next month .
Gordon Murray and Rae MacKenzie , the two councillors who launched the petition , are both from the town of Stornoway in the isle of Lewis .
At the council 's meeting , Councillor MacKenzie suggested an alternative budget retaining flight service financing .
The petition says the council 's decisions `` risk the future of all internal flights within the Outer Hebrides and would severely undermine the transport connections which have been built up between the islands over the last forty years , with serious implications for the local economy and community . ''
The council 's decision to remove the £ 148,000 -LRB- about US$ 230,000 or € 172,000 -RRB- subsidy means Benbecula -- Barra flights are to cease operation within the next few weeks .
When the decision comes into effect , travelling between the islands will only be available through the use of ferry services .
The council , which was trying to achieve about £ 5 million -LRB- US$ 7.75 million or € 5.8 million -RRB- in spending reductions , said some 75 % of seats on these flights were vacant .
Angus MacNeil , MP for Na h-Eileanan an Iar in the British Government , and Alasdair Allan , MSP for the same constituency in the Scottish Government , both of whom are SNP members , have criticised the council 's decision .
MacNeil said he was `` disappointed '' about the move and claimed Comhairle nan Eilean Siar was `` axing these services while pocketing the cash '' provided to them by the Scottish Government .
Meanwhile , Allan said the council 's action was `` a significant blow to the community '' .
He said , from Benbecula : `` As someone who used the Barra to Benbecula flight today , it is clear to me what importance this service has in keeping the Western Isles connected . ''
Council leader Angus Campbell subsequently criticised MacNeil for his remarks , saying he was `` extremely disappointed '' by them .
`` The use of the term ` pocketing the money ' shows a disrespect for the democratic process of local Government '' , he said .
He also requested that MacNeil and Allan `` stand shoulder to shoulder with the Comhairle to campaign for increased funding for the Western Isles to help deal with these issues rather than turning on their democratically elected local council over individual issues they do n't particularly like . ''
Campbell described the council 's 2013 / 2014 budget as `` the most difficult we have faced during my time as a councillor . ''

One of the favourites , Alana Nichols from the USA , Did Not Start the race , and another , Kimberly Joines from Canada , Did Not Finish it .

filename:<doc id="709308" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=709308" title="Supreme Court of the United States contemplates same-sex marriage"><paragraph:1_5_6_9_11_15_17_27>:SNT_LIST
March 26 , 2013
This week , the United States Supreme Court is scheduled to address two cases before them on the issue of same-sex marriage .
The federal Defense of Marriage Act case is scheduled to be heard on Wednesday .
The other case involves California 's Proposition 8 .
A ruling is unlikely to be made until June .
The federal case involves the denial of privileges afforded to heterosexual married couples on the federal level , and the legality of states to opt out of recognizing legal marriages performed in other states in the union and to deny state benefits for those couples .
John Eastman , law professor at Chapman University and chairman of National Organization for Marriage , a group that opposes same-sex marriage , believes the eventual ruling will be a close one , with Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy likely to be the key swing vote .
Eastman is quoted by U.S. News and World Report as saying of Kennedy , `` All eyes are on Justice Kennedy and he 's obviously written the two major gay rights decisions in the past decade and a half and that means that people rightly think that he 's kind of open to taking this step , but he has studiously avoided taking that step in prior cases . ''
Other court watchers agree with this sentiment .
In the lead up to the hearings , a number of high profile politicians have expressed their support for same-sex marriage including Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia , Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri , former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Republican Senator Rob Portman of Ohio .
Earlier this month , 40 United States senators signed a legal brief arguing against the constitutionality of the federal Defense of Marriage Act that was submitted to the Supreme Court .
High visibility companies have also indicated support for legalized same-sex marriage in the United States , including Starbucks where CEO Howard Schultz gave company support at a share-holder meeting last week .
After share-holder Tom Strobhar implied at the meeting that Starbuck 's historical position of supporting same-sex marriage , which included open support of the same-sex marriage legalization efforts in the state of Washington last year , hurt the company 's bottom line , Schultz responded by saying , `` If you feel , respectfully , that you can get a higher return than the 38 % you got last year , it 's a free country .
You can sell your shares of Starbucks and buy shares in another company . ''
The company 's position is predicated on respecting diversity , even if it potentially impacts Starbucks earnings .
Goldman Sachs has also supported the push for same-sex marriage arguing that the lack of equality hurts businesses .
Goldman Sachs , Marriott International and Thomson Reuters have all signed a legal brief condemning the federal Defense of Marriage Act .
A `` Washington Post-ABC News '' poll published last week showed support for same-sex marriage in the United States was at an all time high at 58 % , an increase of 21 % since 2003 .
A recent Gallup poll showed similar results , with 54 % of Americans supporting federal benefits for gay and lesbian couples , an increase of 27 % since 1996 when the federal Defense of Marriage Act became law .
Last week , a poll published by Reuters/Ipso found 63 % of Americans supported same-sex marriage or civil unions .
Despite this , social conservatives argue that this support may be over-stated by as much as 7 % when voters are asked to voice their opinion on the issue at the ballot box .
They cite a 2010 study by New York University political science professor Patrick J. Egan .
Social conservatives also argue that people lie to pollsters to avoid appearing intolerant .
2000 Republican presidential candidate Gary Bauer said on Fox News Sunday , `` I 'm not worried about -LSB- same-sex marriage -RSB- , because the polls are skewed .
Just this past November , four states , very liberal states , voted on this issue and my side lost all four of those votes .
But my side had 45 , 46 percent of the vote in all four of those liberal states . ''
Brian S. Brown , president of the National Organization for Marriage , also argues that misleading polling questions over-count support for same-sex marriage in the United States .
Despite the potential for skewed polling , the four most recent ballot initiatives regarding same-sex marriage in the United States on a state level resulted in citizens voting to support same-sex marriage in Minnesota , Maryland , Washington and Maine .
It also comes at a time when the most recent election cycle in the United States saw opponents of same-sex marriage outspent 3 to 1 .

filename:<doc id="783203" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=783203" title="Ryanair threaten legal action after documentary on fuel policy, safety"><paragraph:1_3_6_8_11_14_17_19_22_24>:SNT_LIST
August 14 , 2013
Irish budget airline Ryanair have stated intent to sue the UK 's Channel 4 over a documentary broadcast Monday night which discussed safety at the airline .
`` Secrets of the Cockpit '' focused strongly on fuel policy and featured interviews with pilots .
Part of the Dispatches series , the show reported on an incident in Spain last year where three Ryanair jets declared fuel emergencies after being diverted to Valencia .
Pilots interviewed for the programme said they felt pressured to save fuel , the cost of which has hit Ryanair 's profits .
The Spanish Air Authority described Ryanair flights usually landing with a bare minimum of fuel , in a report the airline dismissed as `` manifestly inaccurate and factually untrue '' .
Ryanair say their planes carry more fuel than European Union legislation requires and point out the Irish Aviation Authority -LRB- IAA -RRB- monitor their safety record , including fuel policy .
Ryanair has never had a fatal accident and the IAA called `` Secrets of the Cockpit '' a `` misguided attack '' which was `` based upon false and misleading information '' .
The IAA itself was accused of failing to respond to concerns from Ryanair pilots and one interviewee said his `` personal belief is that the majority of Ryanair pilots do not have confidence in the safety agencies and that is a pretty critical issue '' .
An IAA statement yesterday morning read `` The IAA has responded to personal letters and reports from Ryanair pilots , this included several meetings and face-to-face interviews with pilots and their legal and professional representatives . ''
The statement added `` Ryanair Plc fully complies with all European and international regulations in all areas of its operations '' .
Channel 4 promised to see Ryanair in court , saying `` We stand by our journalism , and will robustly defend proceedings if they are initiated . ''
Ryanair called the documentary `` false and defamatory '' .
Other claims in the documentary included that twelve cockpit voice recorders had been wiped after serious incidents , which Ryanair blamed on pilot error and said is a common occcurence in aviation , and that a survey by Ryanair Pilots Group -LRB- RPG -RRB- found widespread safety concerns at the airline .
RPG is not recognised by the airline which calls the group '' -LSB- lacking -RSB- any independence , objectivity or reliability '' .
The airline says they conducted their survey , which polled 1,000 flight crew , as part of a long campaign to unionise Ryanair pilots .
The airline makes heavy use of zero-hour contracts , which do not guarantee work and which the Irish Airline Pilots ' Association describe as offering some of aviation 's worst employment conditions .
According to the RPG survey almost 90 % of respondents said the safety culture was nontransparent .
Two-thirds said they felt uncomfortable raising safety issues .
Ryanair had told pilots anybody signing a `` so-called safety petition '' might be dismissed .
One anonymous pilot interviewed by Channel 4 accused the airline of `` threats and bullying '' .
Over 90 % of those surveyed wanted a regulatory inquiry , with RPG saying the survey results were passed to the airline and the IAA .
RPG chairman Evert van Zwol , also a recent Dutch Airline Pilots Association president , said zero-hour contracts tended to make pilots choose to fly when unwell and keep quiet if they had safety concerns .
In 2005 a Polish Ryanair pilot became lost near Rome a few days after attending his son 's funeral , while his Dutch co-pilot was seeing his first experience of navigating severe weather .
In the 2005 incident air traffic control intervened to keep the flight safe from midair collisions .
The Polish pilot told Italian investigators he feared losing his job if he took extra time off work .
The investigation concluded in 2009 he had been unfit to fly .
Ryanair denied he would have been fired for taking time off to recover .

October 17 , 2013
Both the United States House of Representatives and Senate agreed to a bill yesterday to end the government shutdown and to raise the debt limit of the federal government .
President Barack Obama has signed the bill into law .
Workers employed by agencies of the US federal government who had previously been furloughed have returned to work .
The law has funded the government until January 15 and has extended the debt ceiling until February 7 .
The law also establishes a bipartisan committee to look into drafting a long-term budget agreement .
This committee is due to report back to Congress in December .
Republicans did not manage to extract any significant changes to Obama 's healthcare law , the Affordable Care Act .
They had hoped to get the implementation of the law delayed by a year , but have instead provided that those wishing to sign up for healthcare benefits must provide proof of their income .
In a statement , the House Speaker , John Boehner , said the Republicans would continue to fight Obama 's healthcare law : `` Our drive to stop the train wreck that is the president 's health care law will continue .
We will rely on aggressive oversight that highlights the law 's massive flaws and smart , targeted strikes that split the legislative coalition the president has relied upon to force his health care law on the American people . ''
The Democratic Leader in the House , Nancy Pelosi , said on Twitter : `` The unnecessary shutdown America endured for 16 days has come to an end .
Speaker finally did the right thing and allowed the House to vote . ''

October 18 , 2013
A massive fire is feared to have killed residents and destroyed more than one hundred homes in the Blue Mountains region of New South Wales , Australia .
The blaze is one of the worst New South Wales have seen in more than a decade , said Premier Barry O'Farrell .
Emergency services attempted to evaluate the extent of the devastation on Thursday night , and determined that up to 30 homes in the area of Springwood had been lost .
Mr O'Farrell says it will be a miracle if lives were not lost in the blaze .
Rural Fire Service Commissioner , Shane Fitzimmons said that it could take some time to assess the true extent of the damage , however , and fears it could be much worse .
`` We 'll be counting properties in the dozens , if not the hundreds , '' he said .
Weather conditions are set to ease on Friday , however the firefighters have a huge battle ahead of them , says Deputy RFS Commissioner Rob Rogers .
`` The worst combination is north-westerly to south-westerly and we 've got that now .
We 've got an incredibly long fire front and there is no sign of any rain coming '' .
Schools in the Blue Mountains were evacuated last night , with many residents seeking refuge at emergency evacuation centres around the area .
Around 600 students were transported to Springwood Sports Club for shelter .
While fires continue to cause destruction across the Blue Mountains region , around 100 further blazes are being contained across the Central Coast and in the Southern Highlands .
Residents have been urged to leave areas surrounding the Blue Mountains region , after the alert system was upgraded to an ` emergency warning ' .

December 10 , 2013
Major British charity Comic Relief has invested money in arms , alcohol and tobacco firms , according to a BBC Panorama investigation to be broadcast this evening .
The probe discovered evidence of hundreds of thousands of pounds going towards shares in weapons firms like BAE Systems and alcohol company Diageo .
It is also alleged to have pledged upwards of £ 3 million into tobacco firms .
Ethical fund manager Helen Wildsmith told Panorama : `` If people who 've been giving them money , after watching the television , next year think twice and do n't give that money , because they 're concerned about their investment policy , then that could be argued to be a breach of fiduciary duty .
They 're risking their reputation , and a charity 's reputation is very precious . ''
Comic Relief was founded in 1985 , and since then has taken in nearly £ 1 billion in donations .
It funds charitable organisations in the United Kingdom as well as overseas .
It uses a range of managed funds , which invests the money in the charity 's name - including on the stock market - in order to maximise return .
A spokesperson for the charity told the British newspaper The Daily Telegraph : `` We put the money into large managed funds , as many other leading charities and pension funds do .
On balance , we believe this is the approach that will deliver the greatest benefits to the most vulnerable people . ''
The controversial investments were made between 2007 and 2009 , `` Panorama '' explains .
Peter Bennett-Jones , former chair of the company , defended the investments in a post on The Guardian 's website .
He said : `` The Charity Commission guidance is quite clear that trustees must invest for the best possible financial return , while taking a level of risk appropriate for money in their care .
They should only adopt an ethical investment approach with specific justification and not on the grounds of individual moral views .
This sounds counterintuitive , but it is the law . ''

May 16 , 2014
Yesterday , on Fiestas de San Isidro Labrador in Madrid , Spain , a small protest demanding justice for victims of the Franco regime was held in Puerta del Sol for an hour starting around 8:00 pm local time .
One sign said `` Contra la Impunidad Solidaridad con las víctimas del Franquismo '' , which translates to `` Against Impunity , Solidarity with victims of the Franco regime '' .
The protest started with speakers on a megaphone , and was followed by a march around the plaza several times with the leaders holding a large banner .
They were followed by people chanting , holding flags of the Second Spanish Republic , and holding placards .
There was a police presence around the protest .
Puerta del Sol has historically been important as a place for Spaniards to hold protests about concerns they have in the country including ones that coincided with the 2011 Arab Spring that demanded changes to Spain 's political systems .

September 5 , 2014
The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development -LRB- UNCTAD -RRB- reported harsh economic collapse in the Gaza Strip on Wednesday , calling for its reconstruction .
In a statement to the press , the organizations said that the data included in the report does n't take into consideration the outcomes of the recent conflict with Israel .
According to the Conference 's annual report , the economic growth in Gaza has dwindled from 11 % between 2010 - 2012 to only 1.5 % in the past year , and the cost of rebuilding it is estimated at about 1.8 billion dollars .
The UNCTAD warns of disastrous outcomes if the situation is n't addressed immediately .
Beyond foreign support , the organization recommends taking steps that would allow the Gazan economy to stabilize and eventually stand on its own and decrease its dependence on foreign economies .
`` The situation in reality is graver than what is mentioned in the report , as it was prepared before the latest Israeli offensive operation on Gaza strip , '' said Economic Affairs officer in the Assistance to the Palestinian People Unit in UNCTAD Mutasim Elagraa .
Furthermore , UNCTAD 's coordinator for the Palestinian Territories , Mahmoud Elkhafif , told reporters that now , following the damages caused by the conflict , rebuilding Gaza would require more than 4 billion dollars .

November 14 , 2014
Four men and one woman were in jail in Tyler , Texas as of yesterday morning following a robbery allegedly involving an elaborate scam .
Police alleged Alneisha Butler originated a scheme to lure a 25-year-old man to an apartment complex in Tyler late Tuesday night , where he was accosted at gun point by four men .
Butler and the man had been corresponding online for a few weeks , when she told him she wanted him to meet some friends of hers , according to police .
When the two met at the complex , they were met by the four men who demanded money from the victim .
He did n't have cash , so the assailants ordered him to get cash from an ATM -LRB- Automated Teller Machine -RRB- while they held the woman until his return .
The man left the scene and notified police by phone .
The men named as alleged assailants in the crime were Lawrence Caston , Shannon Howard , Justin McGee , and David Roberts .
The woman and each of the four men were being held on a US$ 750,000 bond .
A police spokesperson cautioned , `` This could have -LSB- just as -RSB- easily happened if he met her at a bar as it happened online .
If you go somewhere with someone and they start leading you to a place you do n't feel comfortable , then do n't go '' .

December 8 , 2014
NASA has finally accomplished its first spaceflight with the new Orion spacecraft , uncrewed , on Friday morning .
The spacecraft has now traveled farther from the Earth than any other spacecraft designed to carry a crew has traveled in over four decades .
The Orion crew module was launched off from Space Launch Complex 37 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida mounted on top of a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket .
Four and a half hours later , the space module landed in the Pacific Ocean .
During the mission , the spacecraft reached an altitude of 3,600 miles -LRB- 5800 kilometers -RRB- and experienced periods of intense radiation when traveling twice through the Van Allen belt .
Upon re-entry in the Earth 's atmosphere , Orion achieved speeds of 20,000 miles per hour -LRB- 32,000 kilometers per hour -RRB- and temperatures reached 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit -LRB- 2200 degrees Celsius -RRB- .
NASA has reported the entire spacecraft remained in one piece , with all the onboard computers still working despite the high radiation in the Van Allen belt .
All the parachutes deployed without incident .
NASA said this is the farthest spacecraft have flown since the Apollo 17 mission 42 years ago , opening up new human explorations of space and getting closer to the goal of putting people on Mars .
Had astronauts been on board Orion , they would have experienced 8.2 times the force of gravity on Earth , NASA said .
Astronaut Rex Walheim , of the last Space Shuttle mission , talked about future crewed Mars missions and becoming `` a multi-planetary species '' .
The Orion program manager hopes NASA will look at information from this spaceflight and apply it to the next Orion spacecraft , to be launched by the Space Launch System rocket .

December 22 , 2014
At least six fatalities have resulted this afternoon from a bin lorry crashing in the centre of Glasgow , Scotland .
The accident occurred at about 1430 UTC today , when the vehicle hit multiple pedestrians on Queen Street , then crashed into Millennium Hotel alongside George Square , located in the city centre .
BBC Scotland reporter Laura Bicker reported witness accounts the vehicle `` careered out of control '' and the driver `` slumped over the wheel '' when the crash occurred .
It is not yet clear how many people have been killed or injured , although Police Scotland have reported `` a number of fatalities and people injured '' , with `` all casualties , including the driver of the bin lorry '' , alternately being taken to Southern General Hospital , Western Infirmary and Glasgow Royal Infirmary .
They later said on Twitter at least six people have died and eight people are receiving hospital treatment .
Police Superintendent Stewart Carle said at least seven people suffered serious injury , although the total number of those injured may be greater than this .
Sky News has reported six fatalities and a larger number of people injured .
Superintendent Carle further explained that police will investigate what the force has described as a `` major incident '' for the rest of the day and overnight , although they do not suspect there was any `` sinister '' activity behind it .
They told the council to leave Christmas lights on to help the investigation ; the council had offered to switch them off as a mark of respect .
A winter wonderland attraction has been operating in the area this month .
Anyone with photos or video is asked to email the police at georgesquareincident@scotland.pnn.police.uk .
Social media is abuzz with Scots and their loved ones checking each other are safe , and offering condolences .
`` Absolutely gutted for the families of the people killed today , to think -LSB- ... -RSB- I could 've been killed too is a shock , '' said one woman , who passed the scene shortly before the crash .
She added she had `` seen people in body bags '' and was reluctant to go to get her train in Queen Street Station `` incase I see more bodies '' .
`` Genuinely do n't care about Xmas shopping now -LSB- , I -RSB- was getting so stressed over silly things when other people are losing their family ... will be thinking of them at Xmas '' she said , later telling well-wishers `` Thanks so much guys send your good vibes to their families though they 're the ones that really need it '' .
Another local woman said she is `` stunned '' and she had `` stood in that exact spot yesterday afternoon .
Taking pictures of the lights '' .
She says the city now faces `` Another sad Christmas . ''
She was referring to a police helicopter that crashed into a Glasgow pub on November 29 last year .
Three on board and seven on the ground were killed .

March 21 , 2015
Two mosques in Sanaa , Yemen 's capital , were attacked by suicide bombers yesterday , killing over 100 and injuring over 250 more .
The attacks targeted mosques used by supporters of the Houthi rebel movement , who reportedly support former president Ali Abdullah Saleh and now control Sanaa .
The elected president , Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi , has moved to Aden , to the south .
Muslim militant group Islamic State have claimed responsibility for the attack , according to Twitter accounts known to be connected to the group .
Islamic State are known to have set up a base in Yemen last November , but are not known to have previously carried out an attack there .
A White House spokesman , Josh Earnest , stated that the group 's claim of responsibility can not be confirmed , and raised the possibility the claim could be propaganda .
al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula , centered in Yemen , denied responsibility , highlighting their leader has declared mosques and markets off-limits for attack .
Yemeni Political adviser Mohamed Qubaty attributed the attacks to supporters of Saleh .
Qubaty called the attacks `` a plot to widen the schism between the Sunnis and Zaydis '' .
`` Zaydi '' refers to the branch of Islam followed by the Houthis .
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon condemned the attacks and called for hostilities to cease , urging restraint .

March 31 , 2015
The bodies of two adults and two children were found yesterday at a flat in Gibraltar in a possible murder-suicide .
Two young girls , one aged four and the other only six weeks , were found stabbed alongside a British 31-year-old male and a Spanish 37-year-old female .
Royal Gibraltar Police said despite opening up a crime investigation on the deaths they do not currently believe anyone else was involved .
Police said an apartment letting agency staff member notified them about the property where the bodies were discovered .
Police responded to the flat , in the Boschetti 's Steps area , at around 11:35 local time .
Police said `` They got no answer from within but noticed that the house was locked from inside and that sent a few alarm bells ringing and they decided to call the police -LSB- ... -RSB- At the moment what we are doing is trying to get as much background information from both the Spanish and the UK sides of the family . ''
Police also said the family were not permanent residents in Gibraltar and had entered the British overseas territory only days ago .
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office said they too were looking into the incident .
According to the Spanish newspaper El Mundo , police sources believe the older girl is the woman 's daughter but not the man 's .
Police confirmed `` It is believed that all the deceased belong to the same family '' .
As relatives of the deceased are being sought , the names of the victims have not yet been released .
Fabian Picardo , the Gibraltar Chief Minister , spoke of his shock after hearing about the deaths .
`` As a husband and father , I -- like no doubt all Gibraltarians and residents of Gibraltar -- am in total shock to hear about this terrible crime -LSB- ... -RSB- Gibraltarians are not accustomed to witness this type of incident in our peaceful and law abiding community .
Words will fail us all at a moment like this and all we can do is keep the victims and their families in our thoughts . ''
Due to the incident he ordered parliament be adjourned until Wednesday .

Reports indicate the student was thirteen years old ; police said he was under fourteen .
The student reportedly had a crossbow and knife ; however police have not yet confirmed the cause of death .
Two other teachers and two students received non-life-threatening injuries in the attack .

Police said the motive for the attack has not been established .
The attack happened on the sixteenth anniversary of the Columbine High School massacre in the United States .

November 28 , 2015
A gunman attacked a Planned Parenthood clinic yesterday in Colorado Springs , Colorado , killing three people , including one police officer , and injuring nine more , before he surrendered to police hours later .
He exchanged fire with police in a standoff lasting around five hours .
There were a grocery store and a shopping mall nearby ; police told those who were there to take `` shelter in place '' .
Colorado Springs police lieutenant Cathrine Buckley said the police does n't `` have any information on -LSB- the suspect 's -RSB- mentality , or his ideas or ideology '' .
Authorities said they received a report of shots fired at 11:38 a.m. local time -LRB- 1838 UTC -RRB- ; the gunman was possibly carrying a `` long gun '' and maybe even propane tanks .
Lieutenant Buckley said officers who entered the building `` were able to shout to the suspect and make communication with him and that point they were able to get him to surrender and he was taken into custody '' .
Buckley said police only made contact and communicated with the suspect hours into the ordeal .
The suspect was arrested at 4:52 p.m. after he surrendered to police .
At a press conference yesterday afternoon , police said searching through and investigating the `` huge crime scene '' could take hours or even days .
Explosives teams checked the scene for traps .
Vicki Cowart , president of the Rocky Mountains chapter of Planned Parenthood , said some staff hid in `` safe rooms '' in the clinic as a part of Planned Parenthood 's security protocol .
Many anti-abortion protests have focused on the Colorado Springs clinic ; it moved to its current location , which critics have called a `` fortress '' , a few years ago .
Police evacuated the clinic , and cordoned off the clinic and nearby medical offices .
`` Our hearts go out to everyone involved in this tragic situation '' , Cowart said in a statement released on Planned Parenthood 's website .
`` We do n't yet know the full circumstances and motives behind this criminal action , and we do n't yet know if Planned Parenthood was in fact the target of this attack .
We share the concerns of many Americans that extremists are creating a poisonous environment that feeds domestic terrorism in this country . ''
The National Abortion Federation says at least eight murders have been committed in the US against abortion providers since 1977 .

December 5 , 2015
Yesterday , German Members of Parliament -LRB- MPs -RRB- voted to approve a non-combat German role assisting allies bombing Islamic State in Syria .
MPs voted 445 to support military involvement , with 146 against and seven abstentions .
Germany 's Chancellor , Angela Merkel , brought the vote for military action against IS to parliament following the Paris attacks on November 13 .
The approved action does not allow for German combat against IS , but approves the military to provide 1,200 troops , and reconnaissance and tanker aircraft as well as a frigate to support allies attacking IS in Syria .
Following the attacks in Paris , the United Nations Security Council accepted a resolution drafted by France which allows United Nations members to `` take all necessary measures '' in the fight against IS .
Norbert Röttgen from Germany 's largest political party the Christian Democratic Union of Germany -LRB- CDU -RRB- said diplomatic efforts `` would not stand a chance '' without military action .
A statement from the Germany 's army said they are due to deploy their military `` on the territory of states whose governments have given approval '' to target IS .
They are also set to increase soldier numbers in Iraq to 150 where they are training and arming Peshmerga fighters .
Support for German action in Syria follows the first attacks by the United Kingdom when it bombed an oilfield controlled by IS in Omar on Thursday .
The United States has led a coalition campaign since 2014 bombing IS in Syria which was joined by France in late September .
A member of Germany 's Green Party , Anton Hofreiter , questioned if military action has come too early without a wider plan , saying airstrikes alone `` do not amount to a military strategy '' .
Sahra Wagenknecht of Germany 's Left Party argued `` it is simply a lie '' that German action will impact negatively on IS .
Another Green Party MP , Simone Peter , previously questioned the legality of German help in Syria .
Germany 's Justice Minister , Heiko Maas , said military action is lawful , telling Tagesspiegel newspaper that it `` neither violates international law nor the constitution '' .

January 6 , 2016
On Monday , Spanish football club Real Madrid sacked their manager Rafael Benítez .
They appointed Zinedine Zidane as his successor .
Real Madrid , who failed to win a trophy last season under their Italian manager Carlo Ancelotti , hired former Liverpool manager Benítez as Ancelotti 's replacement for the 2015 -- 16 season .
Benítez had previously won the UEFA Champions League with Liverpool F.C. , the UEFA Super Cup with Valencia C.F. , and the UEFA Europa League with London-based club Chelsea F.C. .
However he was heavily criticised after a 4 -- 0 defeat by Barcelona in the El Clásico at Santiago Bernabéu Stadium and a shock exit from the 2015 -- 16 Copa del Rey for including an ineligible player in the squad , Russian Denis Cheryshev .
Having won only seventeen out of 25 matches with Los Blancos , Benítez 's last match for Real Madrid ended in a 2 -- 2 draw to Valencia in an away match on Sunday ; they are third in the La Liga table , four points behind league leaders and local rivals Atlético Madrid .
Zinedine Zidane is a former Real Madrid legend and coach of Real 's reserve team , Real Madrid Castilla .
Real 's president Florentino Pérez appointed the Frenchman and said Zidane `` knows better than anyone just what it means to lead the Real Madrid first-team squad . ''
Real Madrid has had eleven managers in the twelve years that Pérez has been president .
Zidane , expressing his gratitude to Pérez , said `` I 'm going to put my heart and soul into this club '' .
Zidane was assistant manager to Ancelotti when Real Madrid won their tenth European Championship .
Back in 2001 , Real Madrid paid Turin-based club Juventus F.C. the equivalent of £ 45.8 million to sign Zidane .
Pérez said to Zidane , `` This is your stadium and your club and you have all our confidence and trust to make the fans excited once more .
It makes me proud because I know that for you the word impossible does not exist . ''

May 31 , 2016
Australian opposition leader Bill Shorten , speaking in Cairns yesterday , pledged an A$ 500 million fund towards research and programs to help protect Australia 's environmental icon The Great Barrier Reef .
Recent surveys indicated coral bleaching has killed more than a third of coral in the Great Barrier Reef 's north and central regions .
`` All of this '' , said Mr Shorten , `` is at risk if serious action is not taken to protect it .
The Great Barrier Reef is an environmental treasure Australia holds on trust for the world '' .
The Australian Research Council -LRB- ARC -RRB- Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies performed the surveys .
Bleaching is associated with higher-than-average water temperatures resulting from El Niño events , affected by climate change .
ARC said bleaching had affected all but seven percent of the reef .
This bleaching event is the third of its kind with notable occurrences in 1998 and 2002 .
This event in particular has had the biggest impact on the reef so far .
Two weeks ago , James Cook University scientists said the government would have to commit A$ 10 billion over the next decade or the reef would be incurable in half that time .
Mr Shorten 's $ 500 million investment in research and protection of the reef would be spread over four years .

December 3 , 2016
Gambian President Yahya Jammeh yesterday conceded defeat to now-President Elect Adama Barrow .
Jammeh , 51 , took power 22 years ago in a bloodless coup .
He had claimed a billion-year mandate .
Barrow , 51 , is a property developer without political experience .
According to the electoral commission yesterday , he won 263,515 votes , equating to 45.5 % , while Jammeh won 36.7 % , 212,099 votes .
A third candidate accounted for 17.8 % .
Jammeh is the nation 's second president since independence in 1965 .
In a public broadcast he hailed `` the most transparent election in the whole world , '' and congratulated Barrow on `` a clear victory -LSB- ... -RSB- You Gambians have decided . ''
Born in Basse in 1965 , Barrow spent several years working as a security guard in London .
He returned home in 2006 and began property development , which he still does .
He expressed disappointment he did not win by a larger margin .
Barrow represents a coalition of parties in an unprecedented co-operation .
He said his first priority is to pick his cabinet , and has proposed a presidential two-term limit and promised financial stimulation .
`` It 's the people who have spoken .
He can not hang on , '' he said .
`` We won the election clearly so there 's nothing he can do about it . ''
Jammeh refused international observations of the election , banned protests following the result , and switched off the nation 's Internet access on the day of the vote .
He pledged to work with Barrow and hand over power in January .

A fighter jet crashed , killing the pilot , at Hat Yai International Airport , Songkhla , Thailand this morning during an annual Children 's Day airshow .
The JAS 39C Gripen crashed onto a runway at around 9:30 am local time -LRB- 0230 UTC -RRB- and exploded , closing the airport to commercial flights .
The pilot was identified as Squadron Leader Dilokrit Pattavee .
Local media reports an airport fire vehicle rolled over while responding .
Children screamed in video footage of the crash .
The Royal Thai Air Force asked that images of the accident not be shared , but this has not deterred the press .

May 2 , 2017
Saturday morning , at 8:00 a.m. local time -LRB- 0500 UTC -RRB- , residents of Turkey who tried to view Wikipedia in any language received only a `` connection timed out '' screen .
According to watchdog group Turkey Blocks , this was not a technical issue but rather the Turkish government barring access to the crowdsourced encyclopedia under a law stipulating it can block websites that contain obscenities or threats to national security .
Just hours later , roughly 3900 officials , scholars , clerks , prison guards , and other employees suspected of being anti-government were fired .
The Turkish government has allegedly previously blocked international websites such as Facebook and Twitter , often after militant attacks or other unpopular events , but has blamed the `` outages '' on overload from users seeking information .
The government did not immediately claim credit for blocking access to Wikipedia , as such , but the Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communications Ministry said access will be restored if Wikipedia removes some content claiming the Turkish government is working with militant groups and issued a statement to the state-run Andalou news agency : `` Instead of coordinating against terrorism , -LSB- Wikipedia -RSB- has become part of an information source which is running a smear campaign against Turkey in the international arena . ''
Wikimedia Foundation spokesperson Juliet Barbara told NPR , `` We are committed to ensuring that Wikipedia remains available to the millions of people who rely on it in Turkey .
To that end , we are actively working with outside counsel to seek judicial review of the decision affecting access to Wikipedia .
We hope the issue can be resolved promptly . ''
The government did publicly announce the firings , stating that everyone dismissed was suspected of associating with `` terrorist organisations and structures presenting a threat to national security '' and it has connected recent similar actions to the failed coup in the country last year .
This is the second political purge to take place since Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan was granted considerable additional powers after the April 16 constitutional referendum .
The Turkish government also banned televised dating shows , stating `` such programmes in which people are introduced to find a friend -LSB- ... -RSB- can not be permitted . ''

May 27 , 2017
British police announced yesterday they believe they have arrested most of the confederates of suicide bomber Salman Abedi , who attacked an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester this Monday , killing 22 and injuring 116 , of whom 23 were still in critical condition .
As of this morning , eleven people were being held for questioning .
One woman and one teenage boy were questioned and released .
Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley , Britain 's counterterrorism chief , reassured the public yesterday .
`` Enjoy yourselves and be reassured by the greater policing presence you will see , '' said Rowley .
`` We ca n't let the terrorists win by dissuading us from going about our normal business . ''
However , the official threat level of `` critical '' , indicating another attack may be imminent , is still in place this weekend .
Officers equipped with firearms , which are not as common in the United Kingdom as in the United States , patrol some streets and beaches .
Police and other experts said they believe Abedi , 22 , could not have built such a sophisticated bomb by himself and must have had accomplices .
The nuts and bolts inside it had been arranged with care to cause maximum damage , as if the person who made it had some experience .
`` I think he saw children , Muslim children , dying everywhere , '' Abedi 's sister Jomana told reporters concerning her brother 's motives .
`` He saw the explosives America drops on children in Syria , and he wanted revenge .
Whether he got that is between him and God . ''
According to CNN , a friend of the Abedi family said Abedi wanted revenge for the gang killing of a friend .
Several members of the Muslim community in Manchester , including the `` imam '' of his local mosque , had contacted authorities about Abedi , who had been expressing extremist and violent views for some time .
Abedi was born and raised in Manchester to parents who fled Gaddafi-era Libya .
His father returned there after the 2011 regime change and Abedi and his mother and brother joined him later .
Abedi reportedly returned to the United Kingdom shortly before the bombing . ''
-LSB- T -RSB- here has been enormous progress with the investigation , but still an awful lot of work to do '' Manchester police chief constable Ian Hopkins told the press .
He also said the rate of hate crimes in his jurisdiction had nearly doubled this week , from 28 daily to 56 .

June 5 , 2017
Saturday night in the UK , three men wearing what were later found to be fake suicide vests drove a van into crowds on London Bridge , then exited the van at Borough Market and began to stab people with blades , killing seven and injuring at least 48 .
All three were shot and killed by police , who went on to arrest at least twelve other people .
Militants from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant claimed responsibility .
Prime Minister Theresa May says that the attacks on Westminster Bridge , Manchester Arena , and now London Bridge were not connected through any known network but did attribute the attack to the `` evil ideology of Islamist extremism '' .
According to the BBC , a witness to the attack heard one or more of the perpetrators say `` this is for Allah . ''
`` Enough is enough , '' said May .
`` There is , to be frank , far too much tolerance of extremism in our country .
So we need to become far more robust at identifying it and stamping it out -LSB- ... -RSB- That will require some difficult and often embarrassing conversations .
We need to live our lives not in a series of separated , segregated communities but as one truly United Kingdom . ''
The Muslim Council of Britain condemned the attacks : `` These acts of violence were truly shocking and I condemn them in the strongest terms .
Muslims everywhere are outraged and disgusted at these cowards who once again have destroyed the lives of our fellow Britons .
That this should happen in this month of Ramadan , when many Muslims were praying and fasting only goes to show that these people respect neither life nor faith '' said the organization 's Secretary General , Harun Khan .
Yesterday morning there was no train service to London Bridge station .
Because the site was still cordoned off , many people had to take miles-long detours , often on foot , to get to work or else had to wait outside for long periods .
Security office Mohammed Osman told the press : `` I 'm not feeling worried .
I 'm strong enough .
These enemies are trying to divide us but we have to be together . ''
While most of the country 's political parties have decided to suspend campaigning temporarily , the upcoming general elections scheduled for Thursday have not been cancelled .
According to the `` BBC '' , this attack differs from the one in Manchester Arena because creating a bomb requires sophisticated technical skill and operating vans and knives does not .
Some of the people injured in the attacks have been released from hospitals ; as of yesterday , others were still reported in critical condition .

June 20 , 2017
On Saturday , Judge Steven O'Niell of Norristown , Pennsylvania declared a mistrial in the trial of U.S. actor Bill Cosby for sexual assault because the jury had become deadlocked , unable to arrive at a unanimous guilty or not guilty verdict .
Prosecutors immediately announced plans to retry the case .
Brian McMonagle , one of Cosby 's lawyers , addressed the jury , `` We came here looking for an acquittal but like that Rolling Stones song says , ` You ca n't always get what you want .
But sometimes you get what you need . ' ''
The jurors had deliberated for a total of 53 hours , longer than the testimony of all witnesses combined .
They had already declared themselves deadlocked Thursday morning , at which time Judge O'Niell told them to return to deliberations and try again .
On Friday , they emerged to request copies of previous testimony and phone transcripts .
During their deliberations , the jury asked to review the testimony of alleged victim Andrea Constand , particularly her testimony about the 2004 night the alleged assault took place , which produced over 300 pages of transcripts .
Constand claims that , in 2004 when she was working for Temple University , Cosby invited her to his home , where he gave her pills that left her `` immobilized '' and unable to speak and then touched her breasts and genitals and placed her hand on his exposed genitals .
Cosby claims their contact was consensual and that the pills he gave her were ordinary Benadryl , though he has admitted on-record that he gave women quaaludes for sex in the 1970s .
Cosby was accused of three charges of aggravated indecent assault , these being assaulting Constand without her consent ; whilst she was unconscious ; and after using drugs to impair her ability to give consent .
On each charge , a guilty verdict could have placed Cosby , now 79 , in prison for up to ten years .
Many other women have claimed that Cosby assaulted them as well , with specifics ranging from inappropriate touching to rape , but the statute of limitations for many of these complaints has expired , meaning that the crime happened too long ago for the government to legally prosecute Cosby .
However , Pennsylvania law does allow for the testimony of such victims in other sexual assault trials , and one of these women , Kelly Johnson , testified in last week 's proceedings .
Constand did file a complaint with police in 2005 , and the district attorney at the time , Bruce Castor , decided against charging Cosby .
Constand then sued Cosby in civil court and the matter was settled with an undisclosed sum .
However , during his deposition for this civil case , Cosby admitted on the record to giving women quaaludes .
When asked why he thought the jury was unable to come to a unanimous verdict in this case , former Philadelphia prosecutor Kevin Harden Junior said that the jurors probably had doubts regarding Constand 's credibility and cited the fact that only one of Cosby 's other accusers had been allowed to testify : `` By limiting evidence of other accusers , the Court focused the jury on whether the prosecution presented enough credible evidence to convict Cosby of this particular assault .
-LSB- ... -RSB- It would be reasonable , based on the evidence presented , for the jurors to agree that Cosby is a sexual predator and still disagree on a verdict as to the assault of Constand . ''

June 8 , 2017
On Monday , astronomers at the Ohio State University , Columbus , revealed the discovery of an exoplanet , named KELT-9b and according to the university 's astronomy professor Scott Gaudi , it is `` the hottest gas giant planet that has ever been discovered '' .
The discovery was reported online in the Nature journal .
The astronomers say the planet 's surface temperature is more than 4000 °C -LRB- 7232 °F -RRB- , nearly as hot as the Sun .
The planet takes about 36 to 48 hours to orbit around its star , KELT-9 .
KELT-9 is about two and a half times larger than the Sun and nearly twice its temperature .
The star is about 650 light years from the earth , but it is about 300 million years old .
KELT-9 is a blue A-type star , which shines brightly but , unlike some other stars such as our own Sun , their life span is on the order of millions rather than billions of years .
About a year ago , NASA reports , at the Winer Observatory in Arizona , observers using the KELT-North telescope noticed a minute drop in KELT-9 's brightness -- about 0.5 % .
This pattern was observed once every one and a half days , implying the planet comes in between the line of sight of the star from Earth , meaning the planet completes one revolution in that time period .
Observations using the Hubble telescope could reveal whether the planet possesses a comet-like tail , which could help the astronomers estimate how long the planet may live .
Professor Gaudi told the BBC the planet KELT-9b `` is about three times the mass of Jupiter and twice as big as Jupiter . ''
He said the team discovered the planet in 2014 .
He added , `` it took us this long to finally convince ourselves that this truly bizarre and unusual world was in fact a planet orbiting another star '' .
Much like the Moon is to the Earth , KELT-9b is tidally locked to its star ; with one side of the planet always exposed to its star .
Due to tidal locking , the planet 's surface temperature facing the star is roughly 4300 °C -LRB- 7772 °F -RRB- , more than the surface temperature of an average Red Dwarf star .
Its close proximity to its parent star exposes it to ultraviolet radiation , and according to the calculations , the planet loses planetary material anywhere between ten billion to ten trillion grams each second .
Professor Gaudi said , `` It 's a planet by any of the typical definitions of mass , but its atmosphere is almost certainly unlike any other planet we 've ever seen just because of the temperature of its dayside '' .
According to Keivan Stassun , a professor of physics and astronomy at Vanderbilt University , Tennessee , `` KELT-9 will swell to become a red giant star in a few hundred million years '' .
Professor Stassun directed the study with Gaudi .
The discovery was a collaboration between Ohio State University , Vanderbilt University , Lehigh University , and the South African Astronomical Observatory .
They operate a dual-location system , one location in each hemisphere , called the Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope .
Professor Gaudi told the BBC that it was named `` as a joke '' .

July 15 , 2017
On Wednesday , three-time Wimbledon winner Novak Djokovic withdrew from this year 's tournament suffering from an elbow injury .
The announcement was made after the Serbian took a medical timeout during the second set in the quarter-final against Czech tennis player Tomáš Berdych .
Djokovic said , `` It 's unfortunate that I had to finish Wimbledon , a grand slam , this way -LSB- ... -RSB- I mean , if someone feels bad about it , it 's me .
But , you know , I tried . ''
His elbow was problematic for more than a year , he said .
He also said , `` I was able for 30 minutes to play with pain that was bearable .
The serve and forehand were the shots where I could feel it the most and after that there was really no sense '' .
Djokovic 's pre-quarterfinal against Adrian Mannarino was rescheduled to Tuesday , so the 30-year-old Serbian had to play two matches in two days .
Djokovic was two sets down with the scoreboard 7 -- 6 2 -- 0 when world number-two Djokovic decided to stop despite leading their head-to-head record , 25 -- 2 .
31-year-old Berdych therefore advanced to play the semi-final against Swiss seven-time Wimbledon Singles Champion Roger Federer .
Berdych 's best record at the Wimbledon was finalist in 2010 , against Rafa Nadal -- when he defeated Federer in quarterfinal .
The Czech has never won a Grand Slam title .

The killings took place around 11:30 local time -LRB- 0930 UTC -RRB- on Sunday .
The wife , born in 1983 , called the `` gendarmes '' -LRB- police -RRB- in the morning , and they arrived to find her explaining to their five children about the domestic argument which had escalated .
The husband returned while the police were present , and they reported he seemed calm and did not interfere with the children being moved to a neighbor 's home , so they departed .
The woman reportedly chose to leave her house when her husband was not there , and headed to the station , where the husband awaited them armed .
After assassinating his family , the police officer committed suicide .
The wife 's family lived in Guiscard , near Noyon .
The station at Noyon was closed after the incident .

February 3 , 2018
On Wednesday , following the rape in India 's capital , New Delhi , of an eight-month-old girl , Swati Maliwal , head of the Delhi Commission for Women , announced she was beginning a 30-day Satyagrah Aandolan -- a form of non-violent civil protest -- to persuade the Government of India to impose the death penalty promptly when offenders rape children .
She asked for others to join in her protest action .
As reported in the Indian press on Monday , the baby girl was initially in critical condition after she was raped on Sunday at her home in Subhash Nagar in western New Delhi while her parents were at work .
According to the police and a statement by the baby 's father to the agency Asian News International , when the mother returned , the baby was crying and was covered in blood .
A police spokesman said the baby 's 28-year-old cousin was arrested under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses Act and Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code .
After Ms Maliwal visited the baby 's hospital , she tweeted : `` How can Delhi sleep today when 8 month baby has been brutally raped in Capital ?
Have we become so insensitive or we have simply accepted this as our fate ? ''
, and addressed Prime Minister Narendra Modi demanding `` stricter laws and more police resources '' to combat rape .
She said the baby 's internal injuries were `` horrific '' and `` inhuman '' and had required three hours on the operating table to repair , and she could `` still hear her screams and cries '' .
Others responded with tweets calling the rape `` monstrous '' and `` disgusting and disturbing '' .
In a tweeted statement on Wednesday announcing her protest action , Ms Maliwal demanded offenders who rape children should be executed within six months .
`` I will not go home for 30 days .
I will work in the office throughout the day and at night I will inspect different places of Delhi .
I will do double work .
I will sleep in the office only .
I give 30 days ' time to accept my demands . ''
She also demanded a 14,000-person expansion of the Delhi Police and improvements to police software and forensics resources and reform of the prosecution department .
She asked `` people who understand the severity of such crimes and who really care for their kids '' to join her in going house to house throughout Delhi to get the government to meet her demands .
Since the 2012 gang rape and murder of a student on a Delhi bus , there have been widespread protests in India against rape culture and calls for heavier penalties for rape .
In response the government has made the law stricter and introduced dedicated ` fast-track ' courts .
Problems persist .
There have been other press reports of child rape in the country in recent years , including the kidnapping and rape of a three-month-old in Hyderabad in 2015 and the kidnapping and rape of an eleven-month-old in Delhi in 2016 .
National Crime Records Bureau 2016 statistics list 19,765 child rapes , an 82 per cent increase over the previous year .

June 6 , 2012
A new study by Duke University in the US suggests depressed adolescents who respond to treatment within twelve weeks are at a reduced risk of drug abuse later in their lives .
The research followed about half of a pool of 439 adolescents who had received treatment for major depression and volunteered for Duke University research .
At the five-year study 's conclusion the participants were aged 17 -- 23 .
None of them had previously misused drink or drugs .
Of those who had experienced a reduction in depressive symptoms within twelve weeks of treatment , ten percent went on to have drug abuse problems .
Of the remainder , a quarter became drug abusers .
Alcohol use problems , however , were equally prevalent regardless of treatment outcome .
The study was run by Dr. John Curry , a professor of neuroscience and psychology .
Curry noted that the results for those treated successfully held true `` whatever they responded to -- cognitive-behavioral therapy , Prozac , both treatments , or a placebo '' .
The study has called for major depression disorder treatments to take possible alcohol and drug use into account .
Said Curry , `` When the teenagers got over the depression , about half of them stayed well for the whole five-year period , but almost half of them had a second episode of depression ... what we found out was that , for those who had both alcohol disorder and another depression , the alcohol disorder almost always came first '' .
He also said the study had `` a take-home message '' in `` that alcohol use disorders are very prevalent during that particular age period and there 's a need for a lot of prevention and education for college students to avoid getting into heavy drinking and then the beginnings of an alcohol disorder '' .
Curry , alongside Dr. Susan Silva , a co-author , want more research using larger groups .
They also say work towards a comparison with non-depressed individuals is needed .

July 16 , 2012
Belconnen , Australian Capital Territory -- Earlier today at the Australian Institute of Sport -LRB- AIS -RRB- , Australian Paralympic Committee President Greg Hartung and the Federal Minister for Sport Kate Lundy formally unveiled the Australian Centre for Paralympic Excellence .
The unveiling ceremony started with a speech by Hartung who mentioned how important the AIS was to the Paralympic movement in Australia , with the first Paralympic scholarship holder being Russell Short , who earned his scholarship in 1988 and has subsequently competed in six Paralympic Games , with this year 's Games making seven .
Hartung went on to discuss how many more Paralympians have subsequently been supported by the AIS , including Matthew Cowdrey who credits an AIS run recovery centre at the 2008 Summer Paralympics with enabling him to win a gold medal .
Lundy 's speech followed Hartung 's .
She highlighted how the AIS specifically supports five Paralympic programs including rowing , athletics , alpine skiing , and swimming .
Beyond those , the AIS , with funding assistance from the federal government , provided AUD$ 13.5 million to support the Paralympics for goalball , cycling , and weightlifting , with an additional AUD$ 2.25 million going to grants to support Paralympians directly through Direct Athlete Support grants .
Following Lundy 's speech , the Australian Paralympic Centre of Excellence sign was unveiled .
There are 44 days left until the start of the Paralympic Games .

August 3 , 2012
Yesterday , the Australian Paralympic Committee finalized the country 's Paralympic team by naming 2006 Commonwealth Games gold medalist and sighted guide cyclist Sean Finning to the team .
Finning will be compete in the men 's tandem track and road events where he will serve as Bryce Lindores 's pilot .
Finning was not originally to be on the team , and is a last-minute replacement for Mark Jamieson who found himself unable to acquire a visa to compete at the Games because of a criminal conviction on his record .
The pairing is not a new one , as the duo had competed together at the 2010 Road World Cup and 2011 UCI Para-Cycling Track World Championships .
Finning had stepped away from tandem cycling for a while in order to pursue his own individual cycling ambitions , which saw him compete in February at the Ararat Classic Track Carnival and in March at the Bendigo International Madison and the Oceania championships in New Zealand .
Finning and Bryce 's 2012 Paralympic campaign gets underway on August 30 at the Velodrome for track events and September 4 at Brand 's Hatch for road events .

August 23 , 2012
A court in South Africa yesterday gave a life sentence to farm worker Chris Mahlungu for the 2010 murder of white supremacist Eugene Terre'Blanche .
Although Mahlungu is black , the court found the crime was not racist .
Court and prosecution instead agreed a fight erupted as part of a pay dispute .
Terre'Blanche , 69 , was co-founder of the Afrikaner Resistance Movement -LRB- AWB -RRB- , which conducted bombings in the run-up to elections that ended apartheid in 1994 .
He had served prison time for attacking two blacks , one of whom he was convicted of trying to murder .
AWB protestors hung an effigy of Mahlungu from a noose and dragged it behind a truck outside the court , while the AWB marching band struck up Afrikaans songs .
Mahlungu supporters sang in support of the convict and also chanted the banned song `` Shoot the Boer '' , which originated as an anti-apartheid protest .
Judge John Horn rejected the defendant 's claim of self defence , saying Mahlungu showed a `` flagrant disregard for the deceased 's right to life '' when he beat Terre'Blanche with a pipe .
He also rejected a claim Mahlunga , 30 , had been raped by Terre'Blanche and had contracted HIV as a result .
Mahlunga has said he did nothing wrong and Judge Horn said he `` failed to express genuine remorse '' .
Judge Horn also heard Mahlunga is of limited intelligence and was paid little for his work .
His lawyer said he was upset at having not been paid , and drunk , when he killed Terre'Blanche .
Nonetheless , the judge concluded there was `` no valid reason to deviate from the prescribed sentence '' .
Patrick Ndlovu , 18 , was charged alongside Mahlunga but acquitted of murder and robbery .
Ndlovu received a suspended sentence for housebreaking .
