March 27 , 2005
The opposition parties in Togo held a demonstration on Saturday to demand a delay in the upcoming elections .
The elections to replace the deceased ruler , Gnassingbé Eyadéma , are scheduled to be held on April 24 , 2005 .
The elections were scheduled after an outpouring of international criticism about the army 's installment of the late president 's son as the country 's new leader .
The son , Faure Gnassingbé , initially circumvented the constitutional process for new elections 60 days after the death of a current president , but announced elections after African and European leaders strongly criticized the move .
The opposition is demanding a delay for the election , because they fear they will not be able to carry out a sufficient campaign .
The candidates from the two prominent opposition parties , Emmanuel Bob Akitani and Nicolas Lawson , both registered with the election officials despite the view that elections should be delayed .
In a demonstration in the nation 's capital , Akitani 's supporters cheered as the candidate called for better representation on elected bodies -- something the government denies is a problem .
The supporters of the current government also held a rally in the city , shouting `` No '' to the prospect of delaying elections .

August 25 , 2007
A military plane flying over the Kodori Valley has been shot down , some residents of the Kodori Gorge told Georgia 's Rustavi 2 television by telephone on Friday evening .
After several shots were fired at the plane , it lost control and fell in a hard-to-reach area , they said .
The incident , reportedly , occurred late on August 23 , but the news broke a day later .
Debris of the aircraft have not yet been found , as it crashed in a remote area of the gorge , reports said .
Witnesses , however , told Rustavi 2 TV via phone that they saw a black smoke coming from the crash site .
The Georgian Interior Ministry has confirmed the incident , saying that fire was opened at a plane that intruded into the Georgian airspace over the Kodori Gorge .
It said it was not clear whether it was a Russian or Abkhaz aircraft .
Abkhaz forces were holding large scale military maneuvers , involving at least two army helicopters and two aircraft , near the Kodori Gorge at that period of time .
The Russian air force branded as `` one more provocative piece of information '' a Georgian media report that a Russian warplane was shot down on Friday over the Kodori Gorge in Georgia 's breakaway Abkhazia region .
`` It is one more provocative piece of information directed against us , '' air force spokesman Alexander Drobyshevsky told Interfax .
`` I state once again that no aircraft of the air force of the Russian Federation has violated the border with Georgia .
All air force aircraft are currently on airfields , and the pilots are having a rest , '' he said .
`` If one analyzes all Georgian statements about air space invasions , all of them are launched at night , strange as it is , '' Drobyshevsky added .
The Abkhaz side has also denied it .

August 25 , 2007
Six teenagers have been arrested for questioning in relation to the murder of Rhys Jones in the Croxteth area of Liverpool on Wednesday evening .
The arrests of the four males , aged 15 , 16 and two aged 19 , and two females , aged 15 and 18 , bring to seven the number of people currently held in custody , joining a 15-year-old male arrested yesterday , and to nine the total number of arrests so far .
Five of the teenagers were arrested early this morning , while the other was arrested later in the day .
The arrests were all made in the Croxteth and Norris Green areas of Liverpool , the two females together at the same location , the four males at separate locations .
Detective Superintendent David Kelly later said one of the 19-year-old males is being treated in hospital for minor injuries he suffered during the arrest , having fallen from a first-floor window trying to escape .
Det Supt Kelly also said the police would like to talk to a dark-haired woman in particular , saying : `` The woman could potentially be a key witness .
We know from our inquiries there was a woman pushing a pram minutes before Rhys was killed and we believe she will have passed within close proximity to the killer . ''
He added that the killer emerged from a housing estate behind the Fir Tree pub and rode around on his bicycle at the back of the pub for a few minutes before firing three shots , one of which hit Rhys , who had been walking home alone after football practice , in the neck .
Police are still examining a bicycle found abandoned yesterday , but have yet to find the murder weapon , said to be a black , long-barrelled handgun .
Chief Superintendent Chris Armitt urged the local community to `` examine their consciences '' and take a stand against gang culture .
He said : `` We understand that people are concerned about giving information to the police , we understand that people are frightened , that 's natural . ''
He added that the police `` have not had the level of information about those key issues that we would expect and that we want '' and reassured members of the public that any witness who came forward would be protected , saying anybody with information must `` stand up and be counted '' .

filename:<doc id="77692" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=77692" title="Malaysian newspaper suspended due to offensive Jesus picture"><paragraph:1_2_3_5>:SNT_LIST
August 25 , 2007
The Malaysian newspaper `` Makkal Osai '' has been placed under governmental suspension from publishing for a month , due to its publication on Tuesday , August 21 , of a picture of Jesus Christ holding a cigarette and a can of beer .
Although the Tamil-language newspaper apologized on Thursday , August 23rd , saying that a graphic artist had erred in downloading the picture from the Internet , some in Malaysia 's minority religions drew a comparison to the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy that erupted in 2005 over a Danish paper 's publication of cartoons that many Muslims felt insulted Islam and the prophet Muhammad .
The altered picture has been traced by a blogger called `` Gateway Pundit '' to an April 2007 post on a blog called `` Religion Makes Me Laugh . ''
The name of the post where the altered image appears is `` Top Ten Reasons Why Beer Is Better Than Jesus . ''
It has been noted that this apparently unwitting use of a satirical Internet graphic bears a similarity to a 2001 news story in which protesters supporting Osama bin Laden were found to have unknowingly used an altered image of bin Laden that included a picture of Bert , the Sesame Street muppet , by his side .

March 26 , 2005
London -- The former British prime minister Leonard James Callaghan , the Baron of Cardiff has died at the age of 92 , just a day before his ninety-third birthday .
He died at his home in East Sussex , leaving two daughters and a son .
His wife , Audrey , died just eleven days ago .
James Callaghan was prime minister from 1976 - 79 before Margaret Thatcher became prime minster in 1979 after the surprise resignation of Harold Wilson .
His premiership could be considered to include some of the bleakest times for Britain , since he was Prime Minister during the 1978 - 79 winter of discontent , when there were numerous strikes .
However , his proudest achievement was the introduction of cat 's eyes in Britain 's roads when he was transport secretary .
Tributes including the prime minster Tony Blair saying he was a `` giant '' of the Labour movement .
Former rival and prime minister Margaret Thatcher said he was a `` formidable opponent '' .
Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown said he was `` mourned throughout the world '' and `` It was a commitment to public service that brought Jim Callaghan into Parliament in 1945 , and while Jim rose to the top he never forgot his roots . ''

August 26 , 2007

Search dogs worked the scene all night .
According to current reports , sometime early this morning , an apartment building in Brittons Hill , Barbados fell into a cave below .
Five family members are known to be trapped in the collapse , although reports have not be made as to whether these are the only individuals involved .
Rescue workers , as well as several prominent politicians are currently on the scene ; two cranes have been deployed to remove debris .
Evacuation has occurred , with an extension of this area being discussed .
Miami Dade Police arrived on the scene late Sunday night and are now in a joint effort with the Barbados Defence Force , Barbados Fire Service and Royal Barbados Police Force to rescue possible survivors .
Prime Minister Owen Arthur also stated that surveys are currently being conducted to determine the stability of the surrounding area , and only after these reports have been compiled will residents know whether they will be able to return to their homes .
A cadaver dog was sent into the cavern and has identified two areas where there are possible dead bodies .
Sadly it is no longer a rescue mission but recovery one .

August 26 , 2007
<BR> Changwon , South Korea Germany takes 1 place in Group F at 2007 FIFA U-17 World Cup with a 5-0 victory over Trinidad and Tobago .
The Germans took the lead in the 5 minute .
Fabian Broghammer got into the left side of the penalty area before taking a low shot into the back of the net .
Substitute Alexander Esswein scored making it 2-0 with a header from a corner kick from Henning Sauerbier .
Esswein scored again making it 3-0 in the 37 minute with a pass from Broghammer .
Germany Captain Patrick Funk scored Germany 's 4 goal at 39 minute from a left-wing cross from Sascha Bigalke .
Wolze sealed the victory by scoring directly from a free kick 3 minutes into stoppage time .
Germany now faces the Americans in the last 16 on August 30 .
Heiko Herrlich -LRB- GER -RRB- , `` Germany coach : '' First of all , thanks to my players who performed very well tonight .
We were nervous at first but after the opening goal everything went as planned .
All credit to the defence for keeping a clean sheet .
We also gave some of the rest of squad an opportunity tonight , and I was confident they 'd play well as I have faith in all 21 players I brought here .
We will shuffle things round to try and win our next game , against the USA , who we lost 3-1 to last month .
Our aim now is just to reach the next round .
Anton Corneal -LRB- TRI -RRB- , `` Trinidad and Tobago coach : '' It was a great experience for the players , and I think we 've given a good account of ourselves during the tournament .
But still we have to try to close the gap -LSB- in quality -RSB- .
In the Caribbean we 're a good team , but on the international stage we have room to improve , especially in terms of our physical level .
What 's interesting is that all the players started as equal here , but if someone has the right passion and knows how to learn from experiences , they develop into good players .
Alexander Esswein -LRB- GER -RRB- , `` Germany forward : '' We played very well and could have scored another couple of goals .
We were also very disciplined in defence , and I think we deserve the win and top spot in the group .
Jesse Fullerton -LRB- TRI -RRB- , `` Trinidad and Tobago goalkeeper : '' Although we started the game very well , we committed some errors in our man-marking .
The World Cup was a good experience for the players , and this game against Germany was the first real test for us .
I 'm looking forward to coming back at U-20 level , where we 'll play with even more commitment .

filename:<doc id="77743" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=77743" title="13 dead as cargo plane crashes in Congo"><paragraph:1_2_4_6_8>:SNT_LIST
August 26 , 2007
An Antonov cargo plane has crashed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , killing 13 people on board .
The plane had just taken off from Kongolo , Katanga with a cargo of tin ore when the aircraft developed engine problems , causing the Russian pilot to attempt to return for an emergency landing .
However , the plane instead crashed short of the runway , busting into flames .
Although 13 have been confirmed dead , the bodies two of whom have not been recovered , two people were rescued from the aircraft before it caught fire .
The pair , one a young child and the other a man in his twenties , are being treated in a local hospital .
The plane had been destined for Goma , Kivu Province 's capital city , carrying a cargo of around nine tonnes of cassiterite -LRB- tin oxide -RRB- and other minerals .
Goma is one of Congo 's main mineral transportation centres .
Air travel has a poor safety record in Africa .
According to the Aviation Safety Network , last year Africa accounted for just 3 % of all airliner flights , but also accounted for 18.5 % of all fatal accidents in the commercial aviation sector .
Mining flights in particular have caused safety concerns , with officials banning flights into Goma from Walikale , also in Kivu , in June .
Prior to the ban , aircraft had been using a stretch of road as a temporary runway while a purpose-built one was being constructed .

August 26 , 2007
The fossilised skull of a Cretaceous crocodile has been unearthed from the coast of Dorset , United Kingdom .
The 58 cm skull , which belongs to an animal called a `` Goniopholis '' , was discovered by Richard Edmonds , earth science manager for the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site team .
`` It 's only the second crocodile skull to be found in the area in the last 30 years .
It was obviously a real piece of luck to find something like that .
The crocodile skull really is the find of a lifetime . ''
he said .
Describing how he located the skull , he said `` A part of my job is to monitor the condition of the rocks and fossils along the World Heritage Site but you do n't expect to find something this spectacular without spending a lot more time on the coast .
The back of the skull was lying in the rubble on the beach and the rest was trapped in the cliff fall . ''
The skull was discovered in April , but because the site is a Site of Special Scientific Interest it took two weeks to receive permission to dig it out , which had to be obtained from Natural England and the landowner .
It was located after a small section was exposed by a cliff fall .
The skull is now on display in the Swanage Museum and Heritage Centre where it is to remain until September , at which point it will be examined by experts from the Bristol University and the Natural History Museum .
If these experts deem the skull to be of scientific significance it will be donated to a registered museum .

filename:<doc id="6580" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=6580" title="Five wounded, two killed in Lebanon blast"><paragraph:1_4_6_9>:SNT_LIST
March 27 , 2005
A large explosion rocked an industrial area in the largely Christian area of Bawshriyeh , east of the Lebanese capital of Beirut .
The blast occurred at approximately 21:30 local time on Saturday .
It is believed that five people have been wounded , two have died , and that three buildings were set ablaze .
An unnamed Lebanese security source stated that a car rigged with explosives was the cause of the explosion .
No group has of yet claimed responsibility .
This is the third blast to have targeted Lebanese Christians in a little over a week , and the anti-Syrian opposition representatives were quick to blame Syrian-backed elements .
Opposition leader Walid Jumblatt told Lebanese television channel LBC , `` They will use all means to try to destroy national accord .
It is true that today they are targeting Christian areas but before that they targeted Hariri . ''
Former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri was assassinated in February after a car-bomb attacked his convoy .
Hariri had been a vocal critic of the Syrian presence in Lebanon .
The attack intensified internal and international pressure on Damascus for a withdrawal of Syrian forces .
There had been around 14,000 Syrian troops stationed in Lebanon .

August 27 , 2007
The number of horses confirmed to be infected with Equine Influenza in Australia has risen to 47 , all in the state of New South Wales .
So far none of those confirmed infected have been thoroughbred race horses .
The NSW government has confirmed infections at the federal government 's quarantine facility at Eastern Creek and Centennial Park in Sydney ; at Cattai and Wilberforce in North-Western Sydney ; and in Moonbi , Parkes , Berry and Wyong in regional NSW .
It is also feared that the outbreak may have spread to Warwick in Queensland where three horses from NSW showed flu-like symptoms during an equestrian event .
Initial samples were tested in a laboratory in Brisbane revealing the three animals had been carrying the flu .
Further testing will be conducted on samples from the horses in Victoria , although results are not expected until later this week .
All 300 horses at the event have been quarantined .
There are also three suspected cases of the virus infecting thoroughbreds at Randwich racecourse in Sydney , if the horses test positive to the flu they will be the first thoroughbreds to be infected with the virus .
The Federal Agriculture Minister , Peter McGauran told ABC Radio this morning that while the source of the outbreak was not known , it is likely that the outbreak may have been caused by an equestrian event held in Maitland on the 18th and 19th of August .
`` Everyone 's been assuming it was the Centennial Park horses that travelled and infected horses in different parts of regional NSW , '' he said .
`` It would appear at this stage that almost all , if not every horse affected has passed through a Maitland horse event on the weekend of the 18th and 19th , or come in contact with a Maitland horse . ''
Agriculture Minister of NSW , Ian Macdonald told reporters `` It 's early days yet , but a number of horses that attended an event at the property on that weekend are showing clinical signs of equine influenza '' .
`` The NSW Chief Vet , Bruce Christie , has advised me that we need to locate and examine every single horse that entered and left the property . ''
At this stage it appears the Australia wide ban on horse movements which expires on Wednesday may have to be extended , at least in NSW and Queensland .

August 27 , 2007
The American military has been accused of offending people in Afghanistan when it distributed footballs , which had been printed with images of flags from around the world .
One of the flags of Saudi Arabia which contains the shahadah , one of the five Pillars of Islam .
Critics say that this is offensive .
As a result , a protest in the Khost province of south east Afghanistan took place , where 100 people attended .
One Afghan MP , Mirwais Yasini said , `` To have a verse of the Koran on something you kick with your foot would be an insult in any Muslim country . ''
The U.S. forces in Afghanistan indicated the balls were meant to be a gift to Afghan children .
A spokeswoman said , `` Unfortunately , there was something on those footballs we did n't immediately understand to be offensive and we regret that as we do not want to offend . ''
This is not the first time the flag has been used on a football .
In 2002 , there were protests when a planned football was to contain the Saudi Arabia flag for the 2002 Football World Cup .

August 27 , 2007
According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime -LRB- UNODC -RRB- report released Monday , the opium produced in Afghanistan has doubled in the past two years , reaching record highs .
The United Nations ' report determined that 93 % of the world 's opium is now produced in Afghanistan , up 1 % from last year .
In 2007 , 193,000 hectares of land in Afghanistan were dedicated to opium poppy cultivation , representing a 17 percent increase over 2006 .
In addition , the yield per hectare was up from last year , due to favourable weather conditions .
In 2007 , opium yields were 42.5 kg per hectare , while in 2006 yields were 37.0 kg/ha .
Overall in 2007 , Afghanistan produced 8,200 tons of opium , an amount 34 percent greater than in 2006 .
This marks the sixth consecutive year that production has increased despite the United States ' US$ 600 million counter-narcotics program in Afghanistan .
When commenting on the report 's overall findings , William B. Wood , the American ambassador to Afghanistan , said , `` I think it is safe to say that we should be looking for a new strategy , and I think that we are finding one . ''
He refers to the possibility of such enhanced U.S. efforts including spraying poppy crops with herbicides .
This proposal has been opposed by both British and Afghan officials in the past .

filename:<doc id="77796" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=77796" title="U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales resigns"><paragraph:1_4_5_6_7>:SNT_LIST
August 27 , 2007
US Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , after several months of controversy , today announced his resignation after 13 years of public service .
He will leave office on September 17 , 2007 .
While he did not elaborate on the circumstances of his departure , he referred to his tenure as a `` remarkable journey '' and said he had `` lived the American dream . ''
Critics of the embattled Attorney General have called for his ousting for several months , largely over his conflicts with the US Congress over the Bush Administration 's warrant-less wiretapping program , and his firing of nine US attorneys .
Observers have expressed surprise at the sudden announcement , as Gonzales had said as recently as the weekend of the 18th of August that he had planned to stay through the end of President Bush 's second term .
Critics of the Attorney General , most notably Harry Reid , majority leader for the US Senate , have welcomed the announcement , as Gonzales had been one of the most controversial members of the Bush Administration .
President Bush spoke on his `` close friend 's '' resignation saying that he has reluctantly accepted the resignation , but noted that Gonzales ' name had been `` dragged through the mud for political reasons . ''
Throughout the recent controversy Bush has stood next to Gonzales .
Paul Clement , the current Solicitor General , will serve as the acting Attorney General until a replacement has been confirmed by the Senate .

August 27 , 2007
A hot air balloon caught fire and crashed in western Canada .
Two people were killed and 11 were injured .
The disaster occurred as the airship was preparing to take off from Surrey , British Columbia , a suburb of Vancouver .
An unknown source caused a fire in the basket of the tethered balloon , which then broke free and rose into the air .
Of the 12 passengers and one pilot on board at the time , 11 escaped the balloon with severe burns and other non-life-threatening injuries by jumping out in mid-air .
The balloon then collapsed , crashing into a motorhome park with two people still trapped on board , who were killed in the subsequent fire .
Four static caravans and two cars were also destroyed in the blaze .
The two deceased are believed to be a mother and daughter .
Their family was on scene during the disaster and watched as the balloon burnt up and crashed .
Witness Don Randall , who photographed the accident , said the thing went up about 400 feet -LRB- 122m -RRB- in the air at which point it melted enough of the balloon it collapsed .
`` The basket was basically a fireball .
It just dropped like a stone .
I 'm just thinking , ` Oh geez , I hope there 's nobody in that thing .
It 's basically a burning death up there . '' '
Bill Yearwood , an investigator with the Transportation Safety Board of Canada , told reporters what preliminary information was available : `` The crew loaded 12 passengers and was preparing to launch when a fire erupted .
The pilot asked the passengers to get out of the basket .
The balloon was tethered at the time , but then broke and came loose .
The balloon climbed into the air before collapsing in a residential area in the park .
They were all trying to get out .
I ca n't tell you what exactly happened when the balloon was loosened from the tether . ''
Injured survivor Diana Rutledge questioned the pilot , Steve Pennock , 's actions after the fire broke out , pointing out that he was first off the balloon .
`` He was in perfect shape , '' she said .
`` I thought , what is this all about ?
Would n't he have stayed on to try to stop the fires ? ''
Joyce Genest , a resident at the park , also questioned procedure that day .
`` I stopped to watch the balloon get inflated , '' she said .
`` Normally it takes 25 minutes and it 's quite gorgeous to watch .
They are never in a big hurry .
This time they took about ten minutes . ''
She said the passengers then got straight into the balloon , an unusual occurrence .
`` Normally the pilot gets in and tests the gun twice and then everybody gets in . ''
As soon as everybody was in , he hit the gun and the flame went sideways . ''

filename:<doc id="6582" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=6582" title="Cricket: Sehwag dominates, but India trails"><paragraph:1_2_4_5_7_9_11_14_15>:SNT_LIST
March 27 , 2005
India v Pakistan - Third Test , Day 3 - Bangalore , India Virender Sehwag 's characteristic 201 was n't enough to help India to safety , as a late spur of wickets in the final session left the hosts at 6-379 , in response to Pakistan 's first innings score of 570 , still trailing by 191 runs , at close of play on Day 3 of the third and final Test of this historic series .
Sehwag dominated each and every Pakistani bowler during his dominant batting display , a second score of 200 + against the sub-continental neighbours .
His innings , which could have been brought to an end when he was 43 when Asim Kamal missed a sharp chance at short leg , constituted 28 fours and two mammoth sixes .
Sehwag shared vital partnerships with fellow opener Gautam Gambhir , Rahul Dravid and Sachin Tendulkar ; however none of those blossomed into a dominating partnership , which could have brought the match in the middle , instead of giving Pakistan the edge .
Gambhir was the first wicket to fall on the day , when caught at slip off a wide Sami delivery for 24 , ending a 98-run opening partnership .
But his wicket had no effect on Sehwag 's concentration , as he kept blasting ball after ball , reaching the three-figure mark , when the team scored had reached only 150 .
Dravid , on the back of two centuries in the last match , looked solid enough to threaten the Pakistani bowling , however a surprising lapse in concentration had him trapped in front of the wickets off leg-spinner Danish Kaneria , for 22 .
Even as Sachin Tendulkar , the new man in , looked shaky to start with , Sehwag continued his onslaught , reaching his 150 , as well as 3000 runs in Test cricket , becoming the fastest Indian to achieve that landmark .
Tendulkar soon found his feet though ; even playing the customary paddle sweep that he has made his trademark .
His dismissal was brought about by Shahid Afridi , who deceived him , to edge a straight drive to Younis Khan at backward point .
Post-tea , Sehwag galloped to the double hundred , before losing his cool , just two balls later , to Kaneria , giving a simple caught and bowled chance to the leggie .
India lost two more wickets , within just 37 runs , to end up on the back foot at the end of the day .
Sourav Ganguly , eluded of a century since more than a year , was stumped off a well-disguised googly for one , off Kaneria again , who finished with three wickets .
VVS Laxman remained unbeaten on 51 , with Irfan Pathan joining him at the fall on the sixth wicket , that of Dinesh Kaarthick for 10 .
Pakistan 570 all out Younis Khan 267 , Inzamam-ul-Haq 184 , Harbhajan Singh 6-152 India 379-6 V Sehwag 201 , VVS Laxman 51 * , Danish Kaneria 3-97 India trail by 191 runs , with four first innings wickets in hand .

August 27 , 2007
The government of Finland has announced it will offer to send three specialist firefighting helicopters , 25 firefighters and 2-3 forest fire experts to Greece via the European Union to assist with the forest fire emergency Greece is currently experiencing .
Greece is currently in urgent need of fixed-wing aircraft with water-bombing capabilities , assets which Finland does not posses .
If the Greek authorities deem Finland 's offers to be suitable , they will be dispatched with immediate effect , within six hours of Greece requesting the rotorcraft and personnel .
It is thought that the men would most likely be put to use protecting built-up areas in an attempt to prevent the death toll , already over 60 , from rising any higher .
The helicopters have been sourced via a private company .
Finland said that the country could not commit to send the aircraft any sooner without arrangements being made to cover their removal from service , as otherwise safety in Finland would be severely jeopardised , with emergency aircraft unavailable should Finland experience any fires of its own .
The helicopters Finland have available can each carry up to 800 litres of water or foam retardant , whereas large firefighting planes can carry tens of thousands of litres .
Finland had previously thought they would be unable to spare any help for Greece , and it was only after much sourcing of aircraft from the private sector that Finland was able to make the offer .
Finland are also looking into whether they may be of assistance in reforestation efforts after the fires have been extinguished .

filename:<doc id="77820" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=77820" title="Obesity rates rise across most of the U.S."><paragraph:1_3_4_6_7_9_11>:SNT_LIST
August 28 , 2007
According to the Trust for America 's Health -LRB- TFAH -RRB- research group , obesity rates in 31 states in the United States continued to climb .
Not one state showed a decline in obesity rates in the latest report released Monday .
The data presented in the Trust for America 's Health 's `` F as in Fat : How Obesity Policies are Failing in America , 2007 '' report is primarily sourced from CDC 's Pediatric Nutrition Surveillance System -LRB- PedNSS -RRB- and Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System -LRB- BRFSS -RRB- surveys .
Mississippi became the first state to have more than 30 percent of its residents considered to be obese .
West Virginia and Alabama , however , edged very close to the 30 percent marker .
Meanwhile , Colorado continued to hold the title as the leanest state in the U.S. , with less than 18 percent of its residents considered to be obese .
The report also examined childhood obesity rates for the first time .
The District of Columbia came in at 22.8 % , the highest , while Utah had the lowest ranking at 8.5 % .
The TFAH 's director Jeffrey Levi said the government needs to become more involved in preventing obesity .
`` It 's one of those issues where everyone believes this is an epidemic , but it 's not getting the level of political and policymaker attention that it ought to ... As every candidate for president talks about health care reform and controlling health care cost costs , if we do n't hone in on this issue , none of their proposals are going to be affordable . ''
However , Levi did acknowledge that many people believe obesity results from personal decision making and not societal policy .
But Levi said the modern world can help promote good choices .

August 28 , 2007
Thoroughbred horse racing has been cancelled indefinitely in the Australian states of New South Wales and Queensland due to an outbreak of Equine Influenza .
An Australia-wide ban on the movement of horses , donkeys and mules which was due to expire on Wednesday has been extended until Friday .
NSW and Queensland have extended their bans indefinitely .
So far the virus only appears to have infected horses in NSW and Queensland , with 51 confirmed cases and another 400 suspected .
So far all those infected appear to be horses used for recreational purposes and not thoroughbred race horses .
Despite the bans on racing and horse movements , track work will recommence in NSW and Queensland today .
It had been feared yesterday that four race horses at Randwick Racecourse in Sydney had been struck down by the virus , but the horses later tested negative to the virus .
If an outbreak were to occur at Randwick it could affect up to 700 race horses stabled there .
The outbreak comes at a bad time for the industry , as it prepares for the lucrative spring racing season in Sydney and Melbourne .
The AUD$ 1 million Golden Rose event at Rosehill has been cancelled , although it is expected that Melbourne 's spring racing carnival will resume on Saturday as no cases of the flu have been seen in Victoria .
Racing Victoria has also said the Melbourne Cup will go ahead as planned despite the outbreak , even if no interstate or international horses can attend .
Despite fines of up to $ 44,000 and 12 months imprisonment in NSW there have been reports that more than 100 horse owners have been caught moving their horses .
The NSW Primary Industries Minister Ian Macdonald , said it was `` absolutely vital that no-one moves a horse in this state '' .
`` We will be working with police to ensure horses are at a standstill , '' he said .
The racing bans have cost gaming companies Tabcorp and Tattersall 's millions , with Tabcorp losing $ 65 million in revenue on the weekend .
Tabcorp expects to lose around $ 150 million in turnover this week .
Tattersall 's has also said it expects to lose around $ 2 million in revenue per week due to the outbreak .
Investors reacted to the news , slashing 3 percent of the price of Tattersall 's shares and over 4 percent of those of Tabcorp .

As the Federal Labor Party calls for an inquiry into the outbreak of Equine Influenza , federal Opposition leader Kevin Rudd said `` if there is a hole in the quarantine system , it needs to be plugged straight away . ''
Federal Minister for Agriculture Mr McGauran has cautioned against a rushed judgment that failures at the Eastern Creek Quarantine station was the cause of the outbreak .
But an unidentified former quarantine official believes its the most likely source .
Mounted Police patrols during the APEC meeting scheduled for Sydney next week have been canceled , as to plans to bring additional horses from interstate .
Deputy Commissioner Andrew Scipione said `` It wo n't stop us being able to protect dignitaries , the public or police at any planned protest '' Organisers of the World Youth Day Papal mass plans of holding the event at Randwick Race course are also doubt .
Vice President of the Randwick Trainers Association Mr O'Shea said of the current outbreak `` We are going to take a massive financial hit now ... '' `` If we go through both World Youth Day and equine influenza that would be the death knell for training at Randwick , '' Original plans for the Papal mass required 10 weeks where trainers would not be able to use the Randwick facilities , a revised plan which would use the venue for 3 days was suggested .
Mr O'Shea said the three-day plan was `` totally unworkable '' as it would require 24 days of disruption .
Australia 's largest wagering company Tabcorp Holdings LTD announced it has lost an estimated A$ 150 million after the cancellation of last weekends racing , this caused it share price to drop 4.6 % on Monday .
A Tabcorp spokes person said `` Based on its experience to date , if Australian racing -LRB- thoroughbred and harness -RRB- were not to resume until next weekend , Tabcorp expects that the loss in turnover will be in the order of A$ 150m '' Further falls are likely with A$ 1.5 billion in Melbourne Cup and Spring carnival turnover under threat if the outbreak causes cancellation of races .
Tatersalls spokesman said it would have to run into months before it had an significant impact on their earning .
Sportsbet said they stood to lose A$ 20m in turnover each weekend , with A$ 50m turnover at risk for the Melbourne Cup .
An independent study into the 2005 Melbourne Cup conclude it contribute A$ 318m into the Victorian economy .
The racing industry has called on the Government to setup National disaster relief for the industry .
Peter V'Landy , Chief Executive of Racing New South Wales said `` Jockeys ca n't earn an income unless they 're riding .
You 've got stable hands , catering staff , totalisator staff and , you know , there are a lot of small businesses .
I think this is a natural disaster for the racing industry .
It 's a very big industry , it 's one of the top three in Australia , so we are , we are seeking now for financial assistance to these people so they can meet their financial commitment . ''

August 27 , 2007
Italian politics were flamed on Sunday , August 26th , by a statement from Umberto Bossi , the leader of far-right party Northern League , who said during a rally in Ca ' San Marco di Mezzoldo , north of Milan , `` People of this region have never drawn out the rifles , but there 's always a first time '' .
Bossi , who had been minister of reform from 2001 to 2006 , during last days had repeatedly invited people to a tax revolt against the government .
The President of Italy , Giorgio Napolitano , issued immediately a public statement expressing `` a strong call to moderation in Italian politics '' .
Several leftist politicians asked the leader of rightist coalition Silvio Berlusconi to distance from Bossi 's statement but a representative of Berlusconi 's party , Forza Italia , Fabrizio Cicchitto pointed out that `` Bossi 's language is usually strong and metaphorical '' .
Similar comment came from former minister Maurizio Gasparri -LRB- now spokesman of party Alleanza Nazionale -RRB- who explained that Bossi `` was speaking of verbal rifles '' .

March 28 , 2005
Chess prodigy and former world champion , Bobby Fischer , arrived by jet Thursday in Iceland after being released from prison in Japan the day before .
Jailed 9 months in Japan for traveling without a valid passport , and dogged by a U.S. felony charge for violating a government sanction , the 62 year old eccentric chess genius was just last week granted Icelandic citizenship based on humanitarian grounds .
In a first order of business to clear Fischer 's way into Iceland , a lawsuit was filed by his lawyer where he alleges the U.S. government conspired to have him arrested , and that his right to `` due process '' was violated by not providing him notice of the revocation of his passport .
Describing his detention as `` ... harsh conditions , amounting to torture , '' Fischer said he was `` kidnapped '' by U.S. President Bush and Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi .
The U.S. refuses to acknowledge Fischer 's status as citizen of Iceland , but the lawsuit blocks his deportation to the U.S. until the legal matter is resolved .
Iceland does have an extradition treaty with the U.S. , meaning Fischer 's troubles are far from over now .
If deported to the U.S. , the felony charge he faces could carry a maximum 10 year sentence .
The U.S. charges Fischer with violating government sanctions 13 years ago against Yugoslavia .
He traveled to Serbia , then part of Yugoslavia , for a 1992 rematch against Boris Spassky , a Russian chess king , who Fischer defeated in 1972 to become world champion in a famous showdown in Reykjavik , Iceland .
During his flight to a stop-over in Copenhagen while en route to Iceland , Fischer conducted an interview with `` AP Television News '' on board .
`` Bush does not respect law , '' he told the `` AP '' .
`` It 's like in the comics , like Billy Batson used to say ` Shazam ! '
and he becomes Captain Marvel .
He -LRB- Bush -RRB- just says ` Enemy Combatant !
Now you have no legal rights . '
It 's a farce , '' he said .
`` This is absolutely cooked up between Bush and Koizumi . ''
Very opinionated , but normally less outspoken , Fischer 's verbal attacks express outrage over the treatment he is receiving .

August 28 , 2007
Eight months after the January 1st crash of Adam Air Flight 574 into Indonesian waters , the cockpit voice recorder -LRB- CVR -RRB- and flight data recorder -LRB- FDR -RRB- have been retrieved from the wreckage .
The devices , collectively referred to as ` black boxes ' , had remained unrecovered over a dispute between the Indonesian government and the airline over who would bear the costs of salvage .
Only recently has a contract been signed with United States salvage firm Phoenix International , who arrived last week in Indonesia to receive the recorders , working co-operatively with the Indonesian Transport Safety Commission -LRB- ITSC -RRB- and the US National Transportation Safety Board -LRB- NTSB -RRB- .
The boxes were located by an underwater remotely operated vehicle searching the seabed near Majene , Sulawesi , where the plane went down .
They were approximately 2,000 metres -LRB- 6,500 ft -RRB- down and 1,400 metres apart .
The FDR was recovered on August 27 at midday and the CVR was retrieved the following day at 10 a.m. .
According to Tatang Kurniadi , chairman of the ITSC , the boxes exibit only minor physical damage , but there is currently no way of knowing if the data they contain has been damaged or destroyed by their prolonged stay underwater .
The devices will now be sent to Washington for analysis by NTSB specialists .

August 28 , 2007
Greece 's socialist opposition party leader , George Papandreou has stepped up its attack on the government 's response to the most devastating wildfires in the country 's history , with 64 dead and thousands homeless .
Papandreou pointed that the government had been '' `` totally incompetent '' '' in fighting the blazes that continued to rage across southern Greece after five days .
The PASOK president said that '' `` This government was proven to be totally incompetent , unable to handle the fire crisis , like all the other crises it encountered in its four-year administration , '' '' while he met with Greek President Karolos Papoulias at the presidential mansion in Athens earlier today .
Protesters have marched through Athens chanting '' `` down with the government '' '' after Greek television showed householders trying to fight the flames with hoses and buckets , fueling claims that the governmental response had been poorly coordinated .
Another protest is going to take place tomorrow in Thessaloniki and other cities throughout Greece .
The prime minister , Kostas Karamanlis , said on Saturday it could not be coincidence that so many fires broke out simultaneously in so many areas of the country .
Papandreou attacking the government , denounced the claims as baseless conspiracy theories , although across the political spectrum there was agreement that arson may have been involved .

filename:<doc id="77863" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=77863" title="Emergency inspections ordered on all Boeing 737s in aftermath of China Airlines explosion"><paragraph:1_2_3_4_5>:SNT_LIST
August 28 , 2007
The United States Federal Aviation Administration has issued an emergency Airworthiness Directive to all owners and operators of certain Next Generation Boeing 737s to inspect their aircraft in light of recent developments in the investigation of the recent China Airlines explosion .
The measures have been imposed due to the discovery that a structural bolt in the aircraft that exploded had come loose and punched a hole in the aircraft 's right wing fuel tank .
It is thought the bolt came loose after a worker failed to replace a washer after a routine maintenance procedure several months prior to the accident .
Boeing spokesman Jim Proulx said `` This was determined to be an issue of flight safety ... It 's very , very important . ''
Operators must complete an initial inspection of the wing slat assemblies of the affected aircraft in ten days , and must ensure the fasteners are properly torqued within 24 days .
They must then repeat the inspections every 3,000 flight cycles thereafter .
The directive is believed to affect over 2,000 aircraft worldwide .

filename:<doc id="77879" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=77879" title="AllOfMP3.com to reopen soon"><paragraph:1_2_5_6>:SNT_LIST
August 28 , 2007
The controversial Russian music site , AllOfMP3.com , is expected to reopen after a Moscow court ruled that Denis Kvasov , owner of the site , did not break Russian copyright laws and that the site was fully legal .
Mr Kvasov argued that although no royalties had been paid to the music industry , the site did pay the 15 % of its profits required by the Russian Organization for Multimedia and Digital Systems -LRB- Roms -RRB- .
A spokesperson from Roms said `` We pay royalties to those who sign up with us and ask for them .
But none of the majors , among them I mean labels like EMI and Universal , want their money . ''
A blog post on the website , which had been shut since July , said that `` the service will be resumed in the foreseeable future '' , however no official date for the reopening has been announced .
The court ruling disappointed many including the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry -LRB- IFPI -RRB- .
Tim Jenkins from the IFPI said , `` If it were to resume trading as it was before , it would be in clear violation of copyright laws both within and outside Russia . ''

filename:<doc id="77881" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=77881" title="Sweden suspends commercial flights to Iraq amid allegations of attempted shootdown"><paragraph:1_2_4_7_8_9_11>:SNT_LIST
August 28 , 2007
Sweden has suspended all commercial flights in and out of Iraq amid allegations that an attempt was made to shoot down a Nordic Airways passenger jet .
On August 8 a Nordic Airways McDonnell Douglas MD-83 took off on a flight between Sulaimaniyah , northern Iraq to Stockholm , Sweden , carrying 130 passengers .
Shortly after take-off the pilots noticed a trail of light arcing over the aircraft in a fashion similar to that of an incoming missile .
According to a spokesman from the Civil Aviation Authority , the preliminary view is that `` some kind of rocket '' was fired at the aircraft .
However , the director of Sulaimaniyah International Airport , refuted the allegations , saying `` the pilot 's assumptions were wrong ... in fact , the Kurdish hunters are using spotlights at night .
We interviewed more than 50 passengers who arrived in Sweden and had been on board and they said nothing happened and they had n't seen any gunfire . ''
Sweden 's decision to ban services from Iraq affects two airlines , one being Nordic Airways , which operates a weekly service between Sulaimaniyah and Stockholm , and the other being Viking Airlines , which runs a service between Stockholm and Irbil four times a week .
According to the aviation authority , Nordic Airways has rebooked passengers scheduled to fly out of Iraq onto other services out of the country , but 3,000 people booked onto Viking Airlines 's route are currently stranded in Iraq .
While flights currently remain suspended , Austrian Airlines have also suspended flights to Irbil , citing the same incident and a subsequent resultant security review as their reasoning for the cessation of the route .
Since then , the Kurdistan Regional Government , Erbil International Airport and Suleimaniah International Airport have all been in discussions with Austrian Airlines in an attempt to re-launch flights from the airline .
There has only been one confirmed case of a commercial airliner being struck by a missile over Iraq ; that of the 2003 Baghdad DHL shootdown incident , which became famous as the only time a commercial fixed-wing airliner has been successfully landed without any operational control surfaces .

August 28 , 2007
A law was passed that will prevent clerical , technical and health care workers from striking when the University of Minnesota students return to classes on Tuesday , however , the new law makes no guarantee about workers striking on Wednesday .
According to Jan Johnson , with the Minnesota Bureau of Mediation Services , both sides do wish to avoid a strike if at all possible .
The American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees have filed for a ten-day notice to strike , however , the ten-day notice to strike law requires that the tenth day of the cooling-off period fall on a day other than a Saturday , Sunday or a holiday , thus , Labor Day Monday is out of reason .
A strike , therefore , would not be possible until at least Wednesday , the second day of classes .

August 28 , 2007
West Ham United midfielder Kieron Dyer suffered a suspected broken leg in the Carling Cup tie against Bristol Rovers .
Dyer , who joined from Newcastle United at the start of this season , was carried off on a stretcher in the first few minutes of the game .
The 28 year old was injured in a tackle by Joe Jacobson and the game was delayed before he was taken to hospital .
The Hammers won the match to reach the 3rd Round 2-1 but boss Alan Curbishley said : `` It 's immaterial .
We are so devastated for him .
I ca n't put it into words really .
You put a strong side out and you wonder why sometimes .
We are delighted we have got through but after 10 or 15 minutes the game was immaterial .
Everyone in the dressing room is really down about it . ''

August 29 , 2007
According to the state of Wisconsin , Wal-Mart has avoided paying millions of dollars in state taxes by paying rent on 87 Wisconsin properties .
The Wisconsin State Department of Revenue call this behavior `` abusive and distortion of income . ''
Wal-Mart is doing this by setting up one subsidiary to run all its stores and setting up another subsidiary to own its real estate .
The operating subsidiary then pays the rental cost to the real estate subsidiary and takes a tax deduction for the rent .
This money will , however , end up in the corporation 's own pocket .
As a result of Wal - Mart 's actions , the state tax auditors say that Wal - Mart owes more than $ 17.7 million in back corporate income taxes , interest and penalties from 1998 - 2000 .
The Wal-Mart corporation claims that they are doing nothing wrong , rather they are taking advantage of an overlap of state and federal tax laws in an effort to reduce their taxes and costs .

August 29 , 2007
A statue of former South African leader Nelson Mandela has been unveiled in a ceremony attended by UK premier Gordon Brown and the Lord Mayor of London , Ken Livingstone in Parliament Square .
In a speech Gordon Brown , who had private `` catch up '' talks with Mr Mandela on Tuesday , paid tribute to the 89-year-old , calling him the `` greatest and most courageous leader of our generation '' .
The statue was unveiled and Mandela was assisted to a podium by Mr Brown and others , where he made a speech .
Addressing Mr Brown , Mandela said he wished him `` strength and great wisdom for your term of office '' .
He went on to say it was an honour to have a statue in Parliament Square alongside Winston Churchill and Benjamin Disraeli , and he hoped it would `` symbolise all those who have resisted oppression , especially in my country '' .
Mandela then announced that his international AIDS campaign , called `` 46664 '' after his prison number during his 27-year incarceration in South Africa , was to hold a concert in Hyde Park , London , on 27 June 2008 , in honour of his 90th birthday .
He declared he would be returning to England to see it .
Mr Mandela ended his speech with his trademark `` I thank you '' before a musical gospel-style group performed .

August 29 , 2007
Security firm F-Secure announced on Monday they have confirmed rootkit-like behavior within the software provided by electronics giant Sony in their MicroVault USB memory sticks .
F-Secure had received a report that their DeepGuard software was highlighting an issue when the memory stick was connected .
After closer analysis by F-Secure it was identified that the software was creating a hidden directory within the users computer that neither the user or anti-virus software could detect .
They say that the issue is similar to the one in 2005 where Sony DRM software allowed malware to be hidden from users .
Mcafee , another major security firm , said : `` The apparent intent was to cloak sensitive files related to the fingerprint verification feature included on the USB drives . ''
`` As with the Sony BMG case we , of course , contacted Sony before we decided to go public with the case .
However , this time we received no reply from them , '' said F-Secure in a blog post .

filename:<doc id="6591" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=6591" title="Motive in Wisconsin church murder-suicide a mystery"><paragraph:1_4_7_9>:SNT_LIST
March 28 , 2005
Seven members of a church were killed by Terry Ratzmann , age 44 , in Brookfield , Wisconsin March 12 .
After shooting eleven people , Ratzmann fatally shot himself .
Four victims died at the scene ; three others died at a nearby hospital .
There is no clear motive but police say that Ratzmann , a long-time member of the Protestant Living Church of God , may have been angered by the teachings of church leader , Roderick Meredith .
Apparently , Meredith 's teachings differed from those Herbert Armstrong , founder of the Worldwide Church of God , of which the Living Church of God is a member .
Armstrong died in 1986 and Meredith formed a splinter group of the faith which Raztmann joined shortly thereafter .
Church members said that Ratzmann , described as a loner , had been depressed since he was laid off as an engineering technician in 2002 .
He had been working occasionally at contract jobs since then and his most recent contract as a computer technician was scheduled to end March 25 , a week before the shootings .
Mourners created a make-shift memorial outside the Living Church of God building in remembrance of the seven victims .

Yesterday , Chelsea captain John Terry urged Roman Abramovich to buy Ronaldinho from Barcelona , while Manchester City were preparing to out-bid West Ham with a £ 12m bid for Inter Milan 's Adriano .
On Tuesday , it was reported that Roman Abromovich had met twice with Ronaldinho 's brother , Roberto de Assis Moreira , and given him a trip on his private jet and hosted him at Lanesborough Hotel in Mayfair , London .
Abramovich held the second meeting with Moreira at his Knightsbridge house on Saturday morning and is understood to have put an offer to him that would make Ronaldinho the highest paid player in Europe .
Sven Goran Eriksson , who held talks with Adriano 's representatives on Tuesday , is aware the player does not want to go on loan and City are trying to stretch their budget to give Adriano wages of around £ 70,000 a week .
Adriano said : `` I do n't want to go out on loan again .
I 've already been at Parma , and at that time it was right for my career but now I really must leave for good and that 's that . ''
A statement by West Ham said : `` We are investigating the possibility of a loan deal at this stage . ''
Adriano has slipped down the pecking order at Inter and fellow Serie A side Lazio would take him depending on his attitude .

August 29 , 2007
Celtic manager Gordon Strachan says the 5-0 thrashing of Hearts will make no difference to the Champions League second-leg tie against Spartak Moscow .
`` If we were playing a bad side then you could say everything was going for us , but we are facing a right good side , '' he said about Wednesday 's tie .
It 's good that everybody knows what good players they are and know that the task in front of us is not easy .
When I played , I always had a fear of the opposition that kept you going . ''
Strachan says that fear would help Celtic be wary of Spartak and avoid any mistakes after the 1-1 draw in Moscow .
`` If you do n't have fear or respect , whatever you want to call it , then you have a problem .
There is nothing wrong with a bit of fear now and again . ''
Strachan also stressed that the money that Celtic would earn if they reached the UEFA Champions League Group Stages will not weigh heavily on his players ' minds .
`` It is important for us to be in the Champions League .
We would like to continue and enjoy the experience .
But it 's not for us to worry about the financial side of things .
Ours is to worry about the game and we have to deal with it .
The players do n't think about finances or things like that . ''

August 29 , 2007
Prison officers in England and Wales are on strike today as part of a continuing dispute over pay rates with employers , the Ministry of Justice .
The Prison Officers ' Association -LRB- POA -RRB- announced the strike , the first in its history , at 0600 -LRB- BST -RRB- on the morning of the 29th of August , just an hour before it was due to start .
As the morning progressed , officers at most public prisons across the two countries locked prisoners in their cells -LRB- a `` lockdown '' -RRB- and walked out , aiming to remain on strike until 0700 on the 30th .
The strike has been condemned by the Ministry of Justice , as a breach of the Industrial Relations Act , with Justice Secretary Jack Straw calling it `` deeply regrettable and wholly unjustifiable '' .
Immediately following the announcement of the action , the Ministry commenced proceedings to gain a High Court injunction against the POA .
Such an injunction was granted by Mr Justice Ramsey , who said that there was `` overwhelming case '' for it , after the court heard evidence that a Joint Industrial Relations Procedural Agreement , agreed to prevent industrial action , had been broken .
Despite the court proceedings , the strike continued largely unabated , and was expected to run its full course .
Inmates were at one point reported to have been seen on the roof of Liverpool Prison , however the situation was brought under control without any escapees .
In Wormwood Scrubs Prison , London , all 1,300 prisoners were being looked after by just eight governors , while at Cardiff , as prisoners , locked in their cells , shouted `` You 're breaking the law '' to the officers standing in the car park .
As a result of the lack of staff , prisoners could not be transported to court , were fed in their cells , could not be visited and could not take part in any rehabilitation or community service courses .
In addition , 900 prisoners had to be accommodated elsewhere , unable to be admitted to public prisons .
This evening , this strike was called off by the POA , who issued an order to all of its members to return to work , with further pay discussions expected to come on Friday .

August 29 , 2007
Greece has declined Finland 's offer of three firefighting helicopters and 25 firefighters .
The offer had been made as a result of a request by Greece for aid with the forest fires Greece is currently experiencing .
Greece had stressed at the time that the most urgent need was for fixed-wing aircraft with water-bombing capabilities , assets Finland does not possess .
The Greek authorities said that the equipment Finland had offered was not suited to the task it had been proposed for .
Ole Norrback , current Finnish ambassador to Greece , has already said that Finland is in a better position to aid with reforestation efforts once the fires have been quenched .

Fred Thompson Yesterday , Linda Rozett , left Republican Fred Thompson 's `` exploratory committee '' after serving as communications director for the past several weeks .
Referring to Rozett 's departure , Thompson said , '' `` I do n't know what the story is '' '' .
Whereas , the day before reporter Jo Becker explored Thompson 's past , noting Thompson 's past as a Republican counsel `` sometimes straddled a fine line between investigating his targets and defending them . ''
Becker explained that while `` he famously asked the question '' that revealed the Watergate/Nixon taping system , `` Mr. Thompson was also an active participant in the White House 's efforts to deflect blame from the president and discredit his accusers , plotting strategy with Mr. Nixon 's lawyers and leaking them information . ''
`` The Politico '' reported that the staff troubles in recent weeks and `` fundraising -- is likely to look a bit wan '' caused `` rumblings are raising questions more broadly among Republican insiders about whether Thompson has the discipline and zeal to wage a winning campaign . ''

August 29 , 2007
Two 11-year-old twin brothers were found stabbed in their home in Penn Hills , Pennsylvania on Tuesday .
Their older brother is being charged with the stabbings , one of which was fatal .
Grandfather Lovett Williams said Tyrel was found upon his dead brother , Tyron .
`` Blood -LSB- was -RSB- everywhere , '' Williams said .
Williams went looking for the boys because they did not show up to meet with him after the school day .
Williams recalled the horrifying dialogue , `` I called them and called them and called them , and finally Tyrel goes , ` Pappy , we 're up here , we 're in the attic ' ... He says , ` Pappy , I 'm dying . '
He says , ` I 'm dying , and my stomach hurts , and my chest hurts . ''
While Tyron was pronounced dead at the scene , Tyrel underwent hours of surgery at Children 's Hospital in Pittsburgh and is expected to survive .
Williams allegedly told police that Tyrel said his 18-year-old brother , Troy Lavalle Hill , was their killer .
Troy Hill was babysitting the children .
The boys have a 3-year-old sister who was not home at the time of the stabbing .
Search parties worked throughout the night on Tuesday looking for Hill but he did not turn up until a neighbor spotted the suspect on Loretta Drive in Penn Hills .
Troy Lavalle Hill reportedly has a history of emotional problems .
Neighbors say they will miss Tyron .
`` They were great athletes , straight-A students , just good , little boys ... It 's tough , '' said neighbor Don Taylor .
Another neighbor added , `` Wonderful neighbors , just the sweetest kids I 've ever known . ''
Grief counselors were on duty at the childrens ' middle school , Linton Middle School .
There is no word on a motive in the case .
Grandfather Williams said , `` I do n't know how I 'm going to make it ... I moved here so I could be with my grandsons .
I hope I can survive .
As long as -LSB- Tyrel -RSB- makes it , I might make it , too . ''

August 29 , 2007
The co-pilot and the widow of the pilot of Comair Flight 5191 have sued the United States Federal Aviation Administration , Blue Grass Airport where the crash occurred , and Jeppesen Dataplan Inc , the manufacturer of the airport charts the pilots were using and a subsidiary of Boeing .
The co-pilot was the only survivor in the disaster , which killed 49 people one year ago on August 27 , 2006 .
The aircraft crashed after attempting takeoff on the wrong runway , which was only for general aviation and therefore not long enough for use by commercial airliners .
The National Transportation Safety Board -LRB- NTSB -RRB- determined last month that the primary cause of the accident was most likely pilot error .
However , First Officer James Polehinke and Amy Clay , widow of Captain Jeffrey Clay , allege that all three organisations they are suing were also negligent .
Despite this , one lead investigator has named other contributing factors , including staffing deficiencies in the control tower , an air traffic controller suffering from fatigue , airport charts that were out of date and the fact that vital documents warning pilots of a route change due to construction work did not reach the aircraft 's flight crew .
In addition to the other three companies , Polehinke is also suing the company that designed the lighting system in use at the airport .
The NTSB 's official probable cause for the disaster is as follows : `` The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was the flight crewmembers ' failure to use available cues and aids to identify the airplane 's location on the airport surface during taxi and their failure to cross‑check and verify that the airplane was on the correct runway before takeoff .
Contributing to the accident were the flight crew 's non-pertinent conversations during taxi , which resulted in a loss of positional awareness and the Federal Aviation Administration 's failure to require that all runway crossings be authorized only by specific air traffic control clearances . ''

August 29 , 2007
Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona , Republican Senator Norm Coleman of Minnesota , and Republican Representative Peter Hoekstra of Michigan are all calling for the resignation of Republican Senator Larry Craig of Idaho .
Senator McCain said , `` My opinion is that when you plead guilty to a crime , you should n't serve .
That 's not a moral stand .
That 's not a holier-than-thou .
It 's just a factual situation . ''
And Senator Coleman said , `` Senator Craig pled guilty to a crime involving conduct unbecoming a senator .
He should resign . ''
Craig has agreed to a temporary leadership reassignment according to a statement from the Senate 's Republican Leadership saying , `` Senator Larry Craig has agreed to comply with Leadership 's request that he temporarily step down as the top Republican on the Veteran Affairs Committee , Appropriations Subcommittee on the Interior , and Energy and Natural Resources Subcommittee on Public Lands and Forests .
This is not a decision we take lightly but we believe this is in the best interest of the Senate until this situation is resolved by the Ethics Committee . ''
Craig plead guilty to a charge of disorderly conduct after allegedly trying to initiate in a sexual experience with a male undercover law enforcement officer in a Minneapolis airport .
Meanwhile , Craig said , `` I did nothing wrong . ''
Craig also said he plead guilty to a lesser charge in an effort to keep his arrest as quiet as possible .
Craig said , `` While I was not involved in any inappropriate conduct at the Minneapolis airport or anywhere else , I chose to plead guilty to a lesser charge in hopes of making it go away ... It 's clear , though , that through my actions I have brought a cloud over Idaho .
For that , I ask the people of Idaho for their forgiveness ... I am not gay .
I never have been gay '' Craig , 62 , is in the middle of his third term and is seeking re-election next year .

August 29 , 2007
`` Arung Samudera '' , the Indonesian naval tall ship that was recently grounded off Queensland , Australia , has been salvaged from the beach at Inskip Point and is currently being towed to Brisbane for repairs .
The 35m vessel has been stranded since last Thursday , when she was grounded whilst on her way to the APEC meeting in Sydney .
The ship is expected to berth in Brisbane near the naval barracks at approximately 11 a.m. -LRB- AEST -RRB- .
The tri-masted sailing training vessel , built in New Zealand , is believed to be seaworthy , but has serious damage to her keel and rudder .
After the completion of repairs , the ship is expected to continue to Sydney , although it will not reach it in time for the APEC meeting .
The ship 's 18-man crew are said to be `` very happy '' with developments .
According to the Australian Navy 's Commander Forbes Peters , Indonesian officials are as pleased as the ships crew , with Peters saying `` The naval attache and the first secretary to the ambassador are on site here and they cuddled Lieutenant Commander Larry Cook .
They are over the moon and I 'm sure the commanding officer is as well , even though he 's currently at sea on his ship . ''

August 30 , 2007
Announced early Wednesday morning at Nokia 's GoEvent , in a plan to expand the company 's revenue , Finland-based company Nokia Inc. is developing a mobile phone similar to its rival iPhone , which will be available in the near future for Nokia customers .
The phone is expected to be available by 2008 .
Most of the features are the same as the iPhone 's .
They include music , games , and many other features , even ones that the iPhone may not have .
Ovi -LRB- in Finnish meaning `` Door '' -RRB- will be the door for more than 2 million songs and games available for download on the new device .
Users will be able to download wirelessly in their own home or anywhere there is access to a computer .
But this is not the first time Nokia has made an attempt like this to increase its revenue .
In October of 2003 the company revealed the N-Gage , a game-playing cell phone , but was `` stocked-out '' due to poor sales .
The N95 smartphone , which was released in the U.S. on April 7 , 2007 -LRB- before the iPhone on June 29 , 2007 -RRB- includes WiFi , a GPS , a music player , and a 5 megapixel digital camera .
The three other phones that were revealed at the event in London will be in-stock next quarter .
The new N81 and the modified N95 smartphones were among the revealed at yesterday 's event ; the N81 is a new member to Nokia 's smartphone family ; the N95 has been modified by having more memory and a sleeker LCD screen .
When Nokia was asked about the striking similarity between this and the iPhone , Nokia 's Executive Vice President and General Manager of Multimedia , Anssi Vanjoki , said , `` If there is something good in the world then we copy with pride . ''
Nokia first demoed their iPhone rival August 29th .
During their demo they omitted the fact that the demo was for the software to be in use , not the actual hardware .

August 30 , 2007
The Ontario Court of Appeal in Toronto has cleared Stephen Truscott of murder charges , nearly a half century after the controversial Canadian crime case began .
Truscott was charged and convicted at the age of 14 for the rape and killing of 12-year-old Lynne Harper near Clinton , Ontario in 1959 .
He was initially sentenced to death but the Canadian government reduced it to life imprisonment in 1960 .
He was granted parole and released from prison in 1969 .
After living under an alternate identity for many years , Truscott began to work towards an appeal of his murder conviction .
Truscott won his appeal when the Ontario Court of Appeal 's decision was released on Tuesday .
This judgment was based on a review of evidence which cast considerable doubt on the prosecution 's original case such as the timing of Lynne Harper 's death .
The Ontario government has started a process to determine an appropriate amount of compensation to Truscott for his years living under a criminal record .
<hr> <hr> Although the court has stated that Truscott was a victim of a miscarriage of justice , it also ruled that it could not declare him innocent of the crime based on the evidence .
Truscott 's lawyers had asked for the ruling on innocence , as the determination could have an affect on the awarding of compensation .
Truscott commented on his relief that capital punishment had been abolished in Canada , as `` there are so many wrongfully convicted in this country and they 're simply just swept under the rug . ''

August 30 , 2007
It has been confirmed that eight thoroughbred race horses at Randwick Racecourse in Sydney have been infected with equine influenza .
Randwick has been locked down , and is expected to remain so for up to two months .
It is expected that the virulent flu will affect the majority of the 700 horses stabled at Randwick .
NSW Minister for Primary Industries said the facility would be quarantined until 30 days after the last sign of the flu .
The cases are the first infections of race horses , despite infecting dozens of recreational horses across NSW and Queensland .
The flu is highly contagious but can not be transmitted to humans .
The national racing shutdown was costing the industry tens of millions of dollars every day .
Chief Executive of Racing NSW , Peter V'Landys said while racing had been disrupted since a ban on horse movements last weekend today was a `` grim , black day '' for the racing industry in NSW .
Racing is expected to resume in all Australian states except NSW and Queensland on the weekend .
While Sydney 's spring racing carnival has been canceled , Melbourne 's is expected to kick off this weekend with the Caufield Cup .
The cup will be ran with special precautions in place to attempt to keep the state free of the virus .
Contact between the general public and those working with the horses will be banned and Sydney-based jockeys Darren Beadman and Hugh Bowman and a number of interstate trainers including Bart Cummings are not allowed to take part .
Federal Minister for Agriculture , Peter McGauran said the spring carnival in Melbourne will remain `` largely intact '' despite losing some of the biggest names in Australian racing .

August 30 , 2007
The High Court of Australia has overturned legislation enacted by the Howard government last year which banned all gaol inmates from voting at federal elections .
The court ruled by majority that the previous legislation which banned only those serving sentences longer than three years would remain .
The case against the amendments was bought to the court by an Aboriginal inmate , Vickie Roache , who is an inmate at the Dame Phyllis Frost Women 's Prison in Victoria .
She was represented by Philip Lynch , director of the Victorian Human Rights Law Resource Centre .
He described Ms Roache as educated , articulate and deeply committed to the rights of prisoners and indigenous Australians .
`` Vickie has stood up not just for the human rights of prisoners and Aboriginal Australians , but the interests of the entire community .
She has done so with courage , integrity and commitment , '' he said .
Lawyers argued that the amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act were in violation of the Constitution which states that the parliament is to be `` directly chosen by the people '' .
Ms Roache 's challenge to previous laws which banned inmates serving terms longer than three years was unsuccessful , with the court upholding them .
The court further ordered Ms Roache to pay half the court 's costs .
There is yet to be an comment by the federal government or a release detailing the reasons behind the courts decision .

March 28 , 2005
The New Zealand Labour Party announced its party list admidst speculations it may call an early election .
The election must be held before -LSB- Sept 24 2005 .
The list ranking is often seen as a ranking of the importance for each politician to the party .
Hon. Parekura Horomia was ranked at number five , the highest ranking of any Maori MP .
The Maori MPs face a strong challenge from the newly formed Maori Party .
Shane Jones , the highest placed non-MP , is all but assured of a seat in the next Parliament .
Steven Ching is placed at 42 , and represents Labour 's interest in courting the Asian vote .
The Asian population has grown significantly over the past ten years within New Zealand .
The surprising absentee is Hon. George Hawkins , the Minister of Police .
He has been criticised for performing poorly in the House , and it is speculated he was offered a low ranking and refused .
He is likely to return to Parliament on the basis of his strong hold on the Manurewa electorate seat .
At the time , no other major political party has released its list .
New Zealand changed its electoral system to MMP in 1996 , before then it used FPP .
In the 2002 election , Labour won 52 seats .
Labour then became government in a minority coalition .
Elections are held every three years in New Zealand .

August 30 , 2007

August 30 , 2007
YouTube videos could once again be viewed today in Thailand , nearly six months after the video-sharing website was blocked for hosting a video that showed images deemed offensive to Thailand 's monarch , King Bhumibol Adulyadej .
Information and Communications Technology Minister Sitthichai Pookaiyaudom said the ministry unblocked YouTube after the website said it had developed ways to block Thailand viewers from seeing contents that violate Thai laws .
In April , YouTube was blocked in Thailand after a video was uploaded that showed graffiti scrawled over the king 's face , and feet being placed over the king 's face ; both highly offensive acts in Thai culture .
Against the king , the offense is known as lèse majesté , a crime that can carry severe penalties .
Sitthichai told `` The Nation '' newspaper that the unblocking of YouTube is not in response to an apology issued in May by the video uploader .

August 30 , 2007

Richard Sukuta-Pasu took advantage of this in the 89 minute scoring for the 2 time in the 2 half .
Mykell Bates scored in Stoppage time to give the Americans a lifeline .
Heiko Herrlich -LRB- GER -RRB- , `` Germany coach '' `` We kept it tight at the back and never gave them a sight of goal .
We were outstanding going forward and with a bit more luck we 'd have been 4-0 up .
Our second goal and the 2-0 lead was totally deserved .
The USA only made headway from set plays and long balls .
I want to congratulate my team .
The important thing now is to keep our feet on the ground and regenerate as fast as possible , as we 'll need to be perfectly prepared for the quarter-final against England .
We 'll be working intensively on preparing to meet our next opponents . ''
John Hackworth -LRB- USA -RRB- , `` USA coach '' `` I 'm having trouble putting my thoughts into words .
The lads have worked so hard and made so many sacrifices to get this far .
We wanted to progress , but unfortunately the tournament 's over for us .
That 's tough on my team , obviously .
Congratulations to Germany , they put us under all sorts of pressure before we threw everything at them right at the end .
It 's a shame we could n't turn in the kind of performance we 're capable of , but my team showed heart and character .
The Germans have a very powerful team and ultimately deserved to win , and all the best to them for the rest of the tournament . ''
Richard Sukuta-Pasu -LRB- GER -RRB- , `` Germany forward '' `` Obviously , I 'm delighted with my two goals , but we can still do better .
We 'll celebrate a little tonight , and then as of tomorrow we 'll focus on England .
The tournament 's not over for us by any stretch of the imagination , we could still go all the way at this World Cup . ''
Josh Lambo -LRB- USA -RRB- , `` USA goalkeeper '' `` It was a tough match for us .
We battled right to the end , but we 've come away empty-handed .
You 've got to be disappointed about that .
We 've learned a lot for the future at the tournament , especially about desire and the need to fight for every loose ball .
Germany are a fantastic team and played tremendously well .
If they can keep playing the way they did against us today , they could go a long way . ''

filename:<doc id="78149" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=78149" title="Four Boeing 737's found with similar fault to China Airlines plane; inspection deadline shortened"><paragraph:1_2_3_7_10_11_13>:SNT_LIST
August 30 , 2007
The United States Federal Aviation Administration -LRB- FAA -RRB- has tightened the deadline imposed earlier for inspection of all Boeing 737 Next Generation worldwide .
The mandatory inspections were imposed after it was discovered that the China Airlines 737 that exploded in Japan had a hole in it 's right wing fuel tank , which had been caused by a loose bolt from the wing slat assembly .
The wing slats are panels mounted to the leading edge of a wing .
They are moved forward during final approach for landing to increase lift from the wing , allowing the plane to fly slower than it can when the aircraft is configured for cruise without entering a stall .
The bolt in question is mounted to the main slat tracks , on which the slats slide back and forth .
As they are extended for landing , they can cause the bolt to be pushed through the adjacent wing fuel tank , rupturing it in the way it is believed the China Airlines plane 's tank was .
Thus far , the inspections have discovered four airliners in which the bolt was loose .
These discoveries give the authorities cause to believe that loose wing slat track bolts may be more widespread than originally considered , and accordingly reduced the inspection deadline from 24 days to 10 days .
After that , inspections must be made every 3,000 operational hours , an unchanged schedule from the original set out at the same time as the 24-day deadline .
The Emergency Airworthiness Directive that the inspections are laid out in is believed to affect a total of 2,287 aircraft sold by Boeing around the world , although the FAA only has the authority to make the inspections compulsory for the 783 aircraft currently being operated in the U.S. Although the FAA refused to release any details on which aircraft were found to have loose bolts , CNN and Agence France-Presse both reported that a fifth plane also exhibited the fault , belonging to Air Nippon and in operation in Japan .
Although the fault was located elsewhere in the assembly , it is believed to have an identically high chance of causing a rupture to the fuel tank .
All 22 other 737 NextGens in Japan have been checked , with no problems being identified .
Meanwhile , Norwegian Air Shuttle demonstrated it 's faith in the aircraft by placing a US$ 3.1 bn -LRB- UK £ 1.5 bn -RRB- order for 42 Boeing 737-800 passenger jets with an option to buy 42 more , having already ordered 11 in May this year .

August 30 , 2007
Scientists have discovered a new species of venomous dart frog in Colombia .
The new species , dubbed the ` golden frog of Supatá ' , is 2 cm -LRB- 0.8 inch -RRB- long and has a range of just 50 acres -LRB- 20 hectares -RRB- , which is believed to be the reason why the frog remained undiscovered until now .
The frog was found in February during an expedition arranged by the Conservation Leadership Program -LRB- CLP -RRB- , a nonprofit organization , but the discovery has only just been announced .
However , according to Giovanni Chaves , a biologist from the CLP , the frog is in imminent danger .
`` This frog exists in a little fragment of cloud forest that is under intense -LCB- -LCB- w | anthropogenic -RSB- -RSB- pressure , mainly the destruction of the forest for cattle-raising and agriculture , '' he said .
`` This discovery allows us to know a little more about the ecology of these beautiful animals , and it will also allow us to use it as a symbol to carry out campaigns of environmental education in this area , to show the need to protect and to conserve the fauna and flora of this region of Colombia . ''
Colombia has one of the richest diversities of amphibians in the world , with more than 583 known species .

August 30 , 2007
At least six to eight vials containing a reportedly poisonous gas were found at a United Nations -LRB- U.N. -RRB- office in New York , according to reports released today .
The vials were potentially hazardous and reportedly came from a chemical plant in Iraq .
U.N. deputy spokeswoman Marie Okabe assured the public they were not in danger saying , `` There is no immediate risk or danger . ''
However , the U.N. Monitoring , Verification and Inspection Commission -LRB- UNMOVIC -RRB- building was evacuated , according to federal authorities .
The recovered gas was believed to be phosgene , which is used to make pesticides and plastics .
The gas can be hazardous at room temperature , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -LRB- C.D.C. -RRB- .
The gas was used frequently throughout World War I .
The gas was brought to the U.S. from a chemical weapons plant north of Baghdad in 1996 .
Ewen Buchanan , a UNMOVIC spokesman , said the phosgene gas was in liquid form , `` ranging in size from small vials to tubes the length of a pen , '' she said .
Jerry Hauer , former New York City emergency services director , told ABC News that `` If it is properly sealed , it should not pose much of a threat unless it is dropped '' and `` They need to get it out of there and put it in a safe canister ... It shows immense stupidity to have that kind of thing sitting around as a souvenir . ''
No toxic vapors were found in the air and no one was injured .
FBI agents , WMD teams , as well as hazmat units were all reporting to the scene .

January 24 , 2005
Colombia and Venezuela continue to clash over the circumstances of the announced arrest of Rodrigo Granda , alleged leader of the FARC .
Colombia released a list of terrorists harbored by Venezuela and a recording of a conversation between alleged members of the FARC .
Venezuela said it will request the extradition of terrorists in Colombia .
In Caracas a march was scheduled by thousands of activists supporting the President of Venezuela Hugo Chavez and protesting against the USA .
President Chavez appeared on television to accuse the USA of being behind the Colombian accusations .
The head of the Colombian Police was traveling in a helicopter when it came under attack by forces of the FARC .
Colombia is supported by the USA in opposing the FARC who are believed to be involved in international drug trade .
Venezuela is allegedly supported by the Foro de São Paulo as member states , along with Brazil , Cuba and the FARC .
According to the Colombian Radio Caracol , La Fiscalía General de la Nación -LRB- Attorney General -RRB- of Colombia revealed proofs of FARC activities in Venezuela -LRB- January 21 -RRB- .
The evidence includes the recording of a telephone conversation between two presumed guerrillas , and a list with the names of seven members from FARC and one individual from Ejército de Liberación Nacional -LRB- the National Liberation Army , or ELN -RRB- who Colombia claims are continuously in Venezuelan territory .
-LRB- audio -RRB- The names of the alleged terrorists , and the crimes Colombia accuses them of , are : This list was sent to the government of Venezuela .
The Colombian Caracol Radio also obtained the recording of the telephone call in which , according to the Colombian authorities , alias Juan Santrich , presumed member of the General Staff of the FARC , talks with alias Jorge Tivieras .
Both men speak in key on the preparation of a political forum that was carried out in the Venezuelan capital in the first days of December .
About a hundred guerrillas were at this event , according to the interpretation of the Colombian authorities .
This information would be sent to Ivan Marquez , of the secretaryship of the FARC .
In the same conversation it is spoken of the attendance of an indigenous delegation .
During the event apparently propaganda would have been distributed and a declaration against president of Colombia Álvaro Uribe was prepared , although the interlocutors do not mention him by name .
The recording can be heard here .
The Colombian newspaper `` El Pais '' reported in a January 23 news release the helicopters in which the head of the Colombian Police general Jorge Castro and other government officials traveled were attacked by ground forces loyal to the FARC when it flew over a zone of illegal farms in the center-west of the country .
No injuries or damage were reported .
After officially receiving from Colombia the list of guerrillas from the FARC and the ELN the Government of Venezuela announced by the Venezuelan minister of the Interior , Jesse Chacón that will request to Colombia the capture and extradition of several ex-military and political leaders in Colombia .
They are accused of terrorism by Venezuela .
Also Chacón announced that his government will study the documentation presented by Colombia .
The Venezuelan Minister advanced some names in the list he will send : Felipe Rodríguez -LRB- retired general of the National Guard -RRB- alias `` El Cuervo '' accused of the attack against the consulate of Colombia in Caracas and the industralist Pedro Carmona , who self-proclaimed president of Venezuela after the coup of April of 2002 in Venezuela .
The Venezuelan Vice-President José Vicente Rangel said the list of terrorists sent by Colombia to Venezuela was frustrating .
According to him the list should be completed with the names of Colombian drug-dealers and paramilitary forces who usually enters Venezuelan territory .
The president of the Venezuelan National Assembly Mature Nicholas denounced a multimillionaire campaign against Hugo Chávez .
He explained the campaign would be being supported by a sector of the Government of the United States from the halting of the guerrilla Rodrigo Granda : `` This campaign has a planning component and execution on the part of the CIA '' .
`` They are going to use it in an international show to indicate it like a species of witness who will contribute testimony in against of Venezuela , our democracy to justify and to give veracity to the denunciations that the government -LRB- of Alvaro -RRB- Uribe has removed from last hour '' .
Mature added that they had information on a new scandal that will be promoted as of the next week from the testimonies that a person of name `` Sonia '' -LRB- protected by USA laws and tied to drug trafficking crimes -RRB- will give .
A march of thousands of supporters to President Hugo Chávez was schedulled to January 23 in Caracas , Venezuela .
The activivists demand respect to the sovereignty of Venezuela , support the Venezuelan governor in the crisis with Colombia and protest against the USA .
According to Venezuelan newspaper El Universal in national chain of radio and television Chávez said that the case of the kidnapping of Rodrigo Granda `` is a new attack of North American imperialism '' .
He accused the `` imperialistic government of the USA '' `` in a hurry run to defend this upsetting and this vulgarity , in addition to the government of Colombia '' .
He described the Secretary of State of the USA , Condoleezza Rice , as `` illiterate '' to not know what it is happening in Venezuela .
He said that the United States is `` the force more negative than can have for this world '' .
`` There is some uncertainty about the date of some events . ''

January 29 , 2005
The U.S. Navy has chosen the US-Europe US101 helicopter to be the next Marine One , the helicopter for the U.S. President .
The present aircraft , Sikorsky SeaKings , are around thirty years old and do not have the payload capacity to carry the modern communications gear demanded by the White House .
The contract is expected to cover the purchase of 23 helicopters .
When invitations were made to industry inviting proposals for replacements , Sikorsky offered their H-92 .
Lockheed Martin did not have a suitable helicopter and , rather than developing , a new design , offered the European EH101 , renamed the US101 .
The US101 will be built in America using mainly US components with some European content .
The EH101 was developed jointly by the British company Westland and the Italian Augusta , who formed the AugustaWestland company .
The helicopter has seen service with the British Army in Bosnia , the Royal Navy in the recent Iraq war and with Canadian Coastguard in search and rescue operations .

filename:<doc id="3824" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=3824" title="Iraqi elections kept low-key, but secure, in Paris"><paragraph:1_3_7>:SNT_LIST
January 29 , 2005
Fourteen countries outside of Iraq have been selected for the installation of polling stations for the Iraqi National Assembly election .
Among these , Paris , capital city of France , will welcome voters from France , Belgium , and Switzerland .
While the event has not been kept secret , the French government and media have been quite discreet about it .
The polling station has been installed in an unused elementary school in a calm residential neighbourhood of the `` XIIIe arrondissement '' , without fanfare .
Most inhabitants are not even aware of its presence -- that is , until they notice the unusual deployment of police and come across the posters written in French and Arabic .
Despite the discretion , the sight of police guarding a polling station is striking in a country where elections are a calm affair on a Sunday , and polling stations , most of which are installed in schools , are only noticeable because of the official billboards carrying the candidates ' posters .
Security measures have been taken -- metallic barriers prevent parking in and around the front and back entrances to the station , and CRS riot police with bulletproof vests guard the entrances .
Still , overall , the security measures remain limited .
Traffic flows in the street , passers-by freely walk in front of the station entrance , no display of heavy weapons .
This contrasts with the use of military troops and deployments of `` gendarmes mobiles '' that France used in its Vigipirate anti-terror plan following the Islamist terror bombings that it suffered in 1995 , or the typical security measures kept around possible terror targets such as the embassies of Israel and the United States of America .
This time , military cars and a handful of soldiers were seen in the morning , but were gone in the afternoon .

January 31 , 2005
New York , USA -- UN Secretary General Kofi Annan has noted that the Iraqi people turned out in large numbers to vote in the January 30 ballot .
Voters were deciding who to elect to the 275 seat Transitional National Assembly .
Sporadic violence saw the deaths of 22 people across the country during voting , but attacks by insurgents did not seem to deter voters from exercising their new democratic rights .
Annan praised the courage of the people and congratulated the Independent Election Commission of Iraq -LRB- IECI -RRB- and UN officials for successfully running the poll .
The Secretary General went on to say that the success bodes well for the on-going transition process .
The next step will be a referendum in October 2005 on the constitution the Transitional National Assembly will be tasked with drawing up .
In the Out-of-Country Voting Program , 93.6 % of Iraqis eligible to vote , did so .

February 3 , 2005
Sam Rainsy , leader of the opposition party in the Cambodian National Assembly , and two other members of his party , Chea Poch and Cheam Channy , have been stripped of parliamentary immunity .
Rainsy has left the country , while Channy has been arrested .
Assembly members are immune to prosecution or arrest for expressing their opinions as part of their parliamentary duties .
Armed forces surrounded the Assembly building in Phnom Penh during the vote Thursday , which requires a two-thirds super majority .
Speaking on behalf of the United States , State Department deputy spokesman Adam Ereli called on Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen 's government to `` allow all citizens to peacefully express their political views without fear of retribution or intimidation . ''

February 17 , 2005
Two sets of remains , one a near complete set , the other just a skull , found in Ethiopia forty years ago , have been dated using potassium-argon dating , as the oldest human remains yet discovered at 195,000 years old .
Remains from Herto , Ethiopia held the previous record of 160,000 years .
The findings , published in the February 17 issue of the journal Nature , show the remains `` Omo I '' and `` II '' , approach what geneticists believe is the age of the human race -- 200,000 years .
Due to geological activity in the region , this number may not be accurate ; it is feasible that the fossils are as young as 104,000 .
The uncertainty is due to the method by which they were dated from the known geological age of surrounding rock .
The exact dig location where the fossil remains had been excavated in 1967 needed to be relocated .
It was determined that `` Omo I '' and `` II '' were buried in the lowest sedimentary layer , dubbed `` Member 1 '' , of the 100-meter-thick Kibish rock formation , near the Omo River .
By searching for datable material in that layer , and then dating it using the potassium-argon method , a research team was able to estimate an age for the fossils by association .
The date found agrees with findings from genetic studies on modern human populations , which use extrapolation to determine a date for the earliest modern humans .
In the same `` Member 1 '' sediment layers , were found additional `` Omo I '' bones , animal fossils , and stone tools .
`` Those who believe that there is widely scattered evidence of ` modern ' behavior going back 200,000 years in Africa will be delighted that modern human anatomy also goes back that far , '' according to study co-author John Fleagle , a physical anthropologist at Stony Brook University in New York .
When comparing the two sets of fossils , there is an anatomical difference between them .
Omo II is much more primitive in appearance , while Omo I more resembles modern anatomy .
Their existence in the same location in the same geological timeframe , may change the way scientists believe humans evolved .
Chris Stringer , director of the Human Origins Group at the Natural History Museum in London : `` Given what we see in larger fossil samples from other regions , we may need to accept that African populations showed large -LSB- physical-form -RSB- variation at this time . ''

February 18 , 2005
John Negroponte , United States Ambassador to Iraq , has been nominated as the country 's first National Intelligence Director by President George W. Bush .
The two-month-old directorate , created by Congress as part of an intelligence community overhaul , will be one of the most powerful positions in the federal government .
Negroponte will oversee 15 intelligence agencies , coordinating operations and setting budgets .
He will , as head of the new office , report directly to the President .
`` John brings a unique set of skills to these challenges , '' said President Bush at a press conference this Thursday .
Negroponte has served in the American foreign service since the early 60 's , from Vietnam to the United Nations and now currently Iraq .
Lieutenant General Michael Hayden , director of the National Security Agency was also announced as deputy to Negroponte .
Senate confirmation is still required before either can assume the offices .
Negroponte has been a controversial figure in the past for his time as ambassador to Honduras from 1981 to 1985 , when the United States under the Reagan administration was involved in violent conflict in Central America .
Fearing that Central American governments were turning towards Communism , the Reagan administration assisted numerous rebel groups in attempts to overthrow left-wing governments , especially in the case of the Sandanistas in Nicaragua .
Central American activists have accused Negroponte of ignoring human rights abuses by the Contras and their Honduran hosts , which the Reagan administration funded by secretly selling arms to Iran .

February 25 , 2005
The Russian oil giant Yukos '' -LRB- Юкос -RRB- '' has lost its bid for Chapter 11 protection by a Texan court .
Yukos sought Chapter 11 protection , to prevent the forced sale of the subsidiary Yuganskneftegaz by the Russian authorities .
Judge Letitia Clark said that the oil company did n't have a strong enough presence in America to warrant Chapter 11 .
The sale was made to pay Yukos ' US$ 27.5 billion tax bill , Yuganskneftegaz was originally sold for US$ 9.4 billion to a little known company Baikalfinansgroup '' -LRB- Байкалфинансгруп -RRB- '' which was later bought by the Russian state-owned oil company Rosneft '' -LRB- Роснефть -RRB- '' .
Yukos was started by the Russian billionaire Mikhail Khodorkovsky , who is in prison for fraud , embezzlement and tax evasion charges that he denies , saying his arrest is politically motivated by the Russian president Vladimir Putin .

March 5 , 2005
The US military is funding the research and development of a weapon that could be used to inflict excruciating pain from up to 2 kilometres away , but is meant to otherwise leave victims unharmed .
Pain researchers have been left furious after work aimed at controlling pain has been used to develop technology aimed at maximising it .
Intended for use against protesters and rioters , the research focuses on the effect electromagnetic pulses can have on pain reception .
Due to be ready by 2007 , the Pulsed Energy Projectile -LRB- PEP -RRB- weapon will fire a burst of electrically charged gas , or `` plasma '' , which will generate an electromagnetic pulse on impact .
It is this pulse which will trigger impulses in nerve cells causing extreme pain .
A review of the non-lethal weapon by the US Naval Studies Board in 2003 concluded that PEPs produced `` pain and temporary paralysis '' in animal test subjects .
Studies ongoing at the University of Central Florida in Orlando aim at optimising this effect .
The ultimate aim is to generate a pulse which will trigger optimum pain in the subject without damaging tissues .
Studies due to be carried out on lab grown cells aim at identifying the threshold of pain that can be inflicted on someone without causing death .
There is some concern that the studies will fall short of demonstrating a safe level for a plasma burst .
The work came to light after documents were released under the US 's Freedom of Information Act to the Sunshine Project , an organisation who aims to expose biological weapons research .
One document entitled `` Sensory consequences of electromagnetic pulses emitted by laser induced plasmas '' concerned the generation and firing of PEPs .
Pain researchers have condemned the research , claiming that it could be put to use as a means of torture and that it is unethical .
`` I am deeply concerned about the ethical aspects of this research , '' said Andrew Rice , a consultant in pain medicine at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in London .
`` Even if the use of temporary pain can be justified as a restraining measure , which I do not believe it can , the long-term physical and psychological effects are unknown . ''
Clinical psychologist at University College London , Amanda Williams expressed concern that victims risk long term harm .
`` Persistent pain can result in a range supposedly non-destructive stimuli which nevertheless change the functioning of the nervous system , '' she says .
Studies `` can not tell us about the pain and psychological consequences of such painful experience , '' she said .

filename:<doc id="5834" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=5834" title="Former WorldCom chief found guilty of all charges"><paragraph:1_3_4_5_8>:SNT_LIST
March 15 , 2005
A federal jury found Bernard Ebbers guilty on all nine counts in an indictment for fraud , conspiracy and false regulatory filings .
The verdict was handed down by a New York jury after 8 days of deliberation on the former WorldCom CEO and mastermind behind the accounting scandal that brought down the telcom giant .
AP writer Erin McClam reported that when the verdict was announced , `` Ebbers ' face reddened . ''
Sentencing is set for the second Tuesday of next week when he could receive 85 years in prison for the conviction .
Ebbers who took the stand in his own defence , said he left the details of the company 's accounting to others and that he had no knowledge of shady practices .
But Scott Sullivan , the ex-chief financial officer of the company and key prosecution witness , directly linked Ebbers to the fraud .
Sullivan agreed to co-operate with prosecutors in the hopes of receiving a lenient sentence for his own involvement in the scandal .
The fall of WordCom sparked a massive class action law suit by investors .
The plunge in WorldCom 's stock changed the capitalized value of the company in the range of $ 11 billion as the scandal unravelled .
Secuities fraud cases stemming from the suits will probably break new legal ground where the involvement of investment banks and public accounting firms who would normally check company irregularities will be called into legal question .

March 23 , 2005
Cambridge , Massachusetts -- Gas With a Smile , an independent gas station on Massachusetts Avenue in Cambridge has filed with the city for a hearing with the license commission to amend its license to do business as Hess Express .
According to the Cambridge Department of Human Services , the Christos Poutahides No. 6 Family Limited Partnership , which owns the station , has asked that they be allowed not to offer repair services at the site .
A hearing will be held on March 29 , 2005 , at the Lombardi Municipal Building at 831 Massachusetts Avenue in Cambridge .
According to a guide published by the city , a `` Garage and Gasoline License '' is required `` for a commercial or residential parking garage with space for 3 vehicles or more to keep and store flammables . ''
Gas With a Smile was shut down by the city fire department in 1999 for failing to upgrade its underground gas tanks to comply with federal regulations passed 10 years earlier .
Hess Express gas stations are owned by Amerada Hess , which operates approximately 1250 gas stations on the eastern seaboard of the United States .

March 21 , 2005
President Bush approved a historic bill designed to keep brain-damaged Terri Schiavo on life-support , shortly after it was sent to him by the US House of Representatives .
`` Today , I signed into law a bill that will allow federal courts to hear a claim by or on behalf of Terri Schiavo for violation of her rights relating to the withholding or withdrawal of food , fluids , or medical treatment necessary to sustain her life , '' said Bush 's written statement .
Bush waited at the White House for the bill 's arrival and signed it into law after returning early from a vacation at his Texas ranch .
The House passed the bill by a vote of 203 -- 58 shortly after midnight in a rare Sunday session called at 9 pm that night .
Democrats objected to a call for unanimous consent earlier in the day .
Although most members had left for the Easter break , 261 of the 435 House members returned for the vote .
Representatives debated the measure in the House from both sides .
Rep. James Sensenbrenner , a Wisconsin Republican , said of previous rulings in Florida that they were `` enforcing a merciless directive to deprive Terri Schiavo of her right to life . ''
He continued that the House should `` reinforce the law 's commitment to justice and compassion for all Americans , particularly the most vulnerable . ''
Democrat Robert Wexler of Florida disagreed , saying `` Tonight this Congress is about to commit a travesty .
Tonight congressional leaders are poised to appoint this Congress as a judge and a jury . ''
The US Senate had passed the bill by unanimous consent earlier in the day .
Terri Schiavo has been on life-support for over 15 years , and is currently cared for at a Florida hospice .
She is considered by physicians to be in a `` permanent vegetative state '' , while her parents contend that she is viable and that there is hope for recovery .
Schiavo 's feeding tube was removed on Friday after Florida courts ruled in favor of her husband , Michael Schiavo , who acts as her legal guardian in the matter .
Terri Schiavo 's siblings , and her parents , Bob and Mary Schindler , challenge this decision .
`` We are very very thankful to have crossed this bridge , '' said Suzanne Vitadamo , Terri Schiavo 's sister .
`` We are hopeful , we are very hopeful , that the federal courts will follow the will of Congress and save my sister 's life . ''

March 23 , 2005
Parker who turns 40 Friday and is best known for her role as the Manolo Blahnik shoe-crazed Carrie Bradshaw on the HBO comedy , Sex and the City , was ousted after less than one year of a multi-year contract .
She signed a three-year $ 38 million deal with the San Francisco-based retailer in mid-2004 and has only appeared in ads for the company since the 2004 holiday season .
`` While Gap will always seek partnerships with celebrities , musicians and rising stars , we do n't have any future plans to sign a single person to a multi-season deal like the unique and special relationship we enjoyed with Sarah Jessica , '' Gap said in a statement Monday , stopping short of calling the ad campaign a failure .
One such rising star slated to appear in the upcoming summer white denim promotion for Gap is 17-year-old Grammy-nominated British singer Joss Stone .
Although Gap would not say its Parker ad campaign was less than successful , the same can not be said for stock market pundits .
`` If you 're like me , and have gotten a little sick of hearing Sarah Jessica Parker sing about how much she likes being a girl on those Gap commercials , '' Alyce Lomax , a stock market commentator for The Motley Fool web site , said .
`` Investors who have been watching this stock know that despite the best efforts of Ms. Parker and the creative teams that came up with the ads , Gap 's quarterly fashion sense continues to be , well , flattish ... in the meantime , other , hotter retailers have stolen the show . ''
In a statement to reporters , Parker called the spilt with Gap a mutual decision , and walks away $ 38 million richer and recently signed a 2-year deal with former employer HBO to develop future programming for the network .
Parker is also scheduled to appear in two upcoming comedy films , a movie adaptation of the Comedy Central series , Strangers with Candy , as well as The Family Stone , costarring Diane Keaton and Claire Danes .

filename:<doc id="6448" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=6448" title="NRA official suggests arming teachers to prevent school shootings"><paragraph:1_3_6_8>:SNT_LIST
March 25 , 2005
A lawyer who is expected to become the president of the National Rifle Association -LRB- NRA -RRB- said in a comment to Associated Press -LRB- AP -RRB- that arming teachers with firearms is a solution to be considered in preventing school shootings by students .
Sarah S. Froman , an alumni of Harvard Law School and a practicing lawyer , implied that allowing teachers to carry weapons is one of the many options that should be examined .
Guns and other weapons are commonly banned on school campuses in the United States , but the high-profile incidents of students defying the bans and bringing firearms to classes could place the school at a disadvantage if the student were to fire the weapon .
In the case of the recent student shooting at a Native American reservation in Minnessota the school had metal detectors and had an on-duty security guard .
The guard was unarmed , however , and was gunned down by the student .
Froman told the AP that if it is the responsibility of teachers to protect students from harm , then the society must find a way to let teachers do that .
She also said that gun control laws or bans can not prevent a malicious individual from acting out , and provided an example of a 1997 shooting incident where an armed teacher was able to help police apprehend the student .
Froman is currently the NRA 's first vice president , and is expected to be elected to the post of president in the organization 's elections next month .
The current president of the 4-million member organization is actor and activist Charlton Heston .

filename:<doc id="7826" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=7826" title="Visiting students detained in Louisiana, USA, while photographing ExxonMobil chemical plant"><paragraph:1_4_6_9_10_14_15_18>:SNT_LIST
April 11 , 2005
A group of 13 students from Antioch New England Graduate School in Keene , New Hampshire , USA , were detained by security officers as they photographed an ExxonMobil chemical plant in Baton Rouge , Louisiana .
The students were accompanied by two professors and an officer from the Louisiana Attorney General 's office .
The officer , Willie Fontenot , was subsequently asked to resign from his position at the Attorney General 's office .
Mr. Fontenot has issued a response , provided to by Steve Case , a professor present at the incident .
Fontenot writes , '' `` Last week , I was asked by Attorney General Charles C. Foti , Jr. to either retire or run the risk of being fired .
No specifics were given to me explaining this decision by the AG .
I have always understood that , as an unclassified civil servant , I served at the pleasure of the AG and that I could be dismissed at any time and for no reason .
Because of my age , health issues , and investment of twenty-seven years in the state system , I decided early retirement was the best option for me . '' ''
The full text of Fontenot 's statement is reproduced here .
According to a press release from Antioch , the group was initially detained by two off-duty police officers who were under the employ of ExxonMobil but dressed in their police uniforms .
The officers were shortly joined by two other security officers who were employed by ExxonMobil .
When asked what reports the officers intended to file , `` the off-duty sheriff 's department officer refused to answer , and instead responded aggressively that he was going to call in ` homeland security ' people who would detain the group into the night , '' said the press release .
In the end , the group was detained for `` more than an hour . ''
One of the professors , Abigail Abrash Walton told the Keene Sentinel that one of the officers , `` aggressively told us that he 'd be calling in the Homeland Security people , whatever that meant , and to expect to be with them all night . ''
The Keene Sentinel reports that the students were visiting the area because , `` Exxon was said to be buying up houses and paying to relocate their owners for various reasons , including that people were allegedly getting sick because of pollution . ''
The other course instructor , Steve Chase , was quoted in the Sentinel as saying that , `` Our objection was not that police officers or even corporate security guards would stop and ask us what we were doing .
That seemed totally fair .
But lies were told , threats were made and the idea was to intimidate . ''
The Sentinel noted that an ExxonMobil spokesperson , Stephanie Cargile , stated that , `` We believe our ExxonMobil Security personnel and the off-duty East Baton Rouge Sheriff police officers acted professionally and cordially to Mr. Fontenot and the Antioch students . ''
The venue in which the statement was made was not mentioned by the Sentinel ; thus far , the report has not been corroborated by Wikinews .

The photo in question originally showed Matts and the Conservative front-bencher Anne Widdecombe campaigning on behalf of an immigrant family living in Weymouth , in the Dorset South constituency , in March last year .
When the photo appeared in Matts ' campaign literature , the people in the background were removed from the photo and a slogan calling for the family to be allowed to stay was replaced by one calling for immigration control .
The seat , taken by Labour 's Jim Knight in the 2001 general election , is one of the most fiercely contested in the country , being Labour 's smallest majority .
Conservative leader Michael Howard condemned Matts ' behaviour but refused to sack him .
Conservative shadow Chancellor Oliver Letwin , from neighbouring Dorset West , said that the message on the doctored photo was consistent with conservative policy .

April 16 , 2005
NB `` This story has also been covered in the article Killer virus sent worldwide .
There have NOT been two incidents .
The World Health Organisation -LRB- WHO -RRB- , in a statement issued Tuesday , urged scientists to destroy samples of a deadly flu virus that could potentially cause a global pandemic .
Shipments of the influenza virus sent to Mexico and Lebanon are unaccounted for .
The U.N. health organization said 10 countries receiving samples already destroyed them , while 5 more countries are in the process of doing so .
The virus , A/H2N2 , was detected by a Canadian lab which contacted the Public Health Agency of Canada , who in turn warned the WHO and other national health agencies on March 26 .
Meridian Bioscience sent routine testing kits infected with the virus to almost 5,000 laboratories , of which 3747 in 18 countries have so far been identified as having the virus , most of them in North America .
The virus is a variant of the H2N2 virus which caused the 1957 Asian Flu Pandemic , but which was displaced by the H3N2 variant .
People born after 1959 are unlikely to be immune to the virus .

filename:<doc id="8638" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=8638" title="Woman arrested in Wendy's chili finger case and larcenous mobile home sale"><paragraph:1_2_4_7_10_13_15>:SNT_LIST
April 22 , 2005
The woman claiming headlines for allegedly finding part of a human finger in her bowl of Wendy 's chili late last month , was arrested Thursday evening at 8:45 pm at or near her home .
San Jose Police Chief Rob Davis , declaring the arrest was part of an ongoing investigation , said Anna Ayala was arrested and charged with one count of attempted grand theft in the Wendy 's incident , and one count of grand theft in an unrelated home purchase transaction .
She is being held under a $ 500,000 arrest warrant .
Chief Rob Davis describes the case as a CSI-type operation where forensics studying the finger found it to be inconsistent with conditions it would have experienced if it were cooked at 170 degrees for 3 hours according to Wendy 's food preparation standards .
The loss in sales due to negative publicity for the chain could range into the millions , a loss for which Ayala could be held criminally responsible .
Davis said , '' ... evidence suggests that the truest victims in this case are the Wendy 's owner , operators and employees here in San Jose , who have suffered financially throughout this investigation . ''
Prior to her arrest , Wendy 's had recently concluded its own internal investigation that turned up nothing to explain the source of the finger .
The San Jose police , who have not accused Ayala , 39 , of planting the finger herself , did search her home on April 6 for evidence relating to a possible hoax .
There are no reports evidence was found .
She has a history of filing suits for financial settlements .
Cases involve the El Pollo Loco chicken chain over a claim her daughter got sick , a sexual harassment suit against her former boss in 1998 , and General Motors in 2000 .
A total of 13 lawsuits in California and Nevada had been filed .
There is an inconsistency in the Ayala account of finding the finger and claiming it caused her to vomit compared with police saying there was no vomit at the scene .
One larceny charge concerns $ 11,000 from the sale of a mobile home owned by her live-in boyfriend .
The two combined charges , which could result in a possible 6-year prison term , are against the backdrop of the Wendy 's chain offering a reward for information to solve the case , which has cost the chain millions of sales .

Monday , May 2 , 2005
, In British Columbia , Canada , leadership debates during provincial elections can have a major effect .
In 1991 , a single sentence during the leadership debate catapulted the then-obscure B.C. Liberal party from no seats for more than a decade to official opposition with 17 seats .
In the current election , three television stations plan to broadcast the event live .
Adriane Carr of the Greens , Carole James of the New Democratic Party -LRB- NDP -RRB- and Gordon Campbell of the B.C. Liberals left the campaign trail on Monday to prepare for the Leadership debate on Tuesday night .
The contestants were heavily prepared , and came into the debate with talking points and notes carefully memorized and at the ready .
Prior to the debates , it was widely reported that Adriane Carr of the Green party had already won simply by being present .
The Green party secured their position in the debate by having a candidate in every riding , 79 candidates in all .
With a steadily increasing polling history in elections but no seats in the Legislative Assembly and a minimal campaign budget , the Green party can only benefit from the opportunity to become better known to the BC electorate .
The Green Party formed in British Columbia in 1983 as part of the international Green Party network .
In the 2001 election , the party achieved 12.4 % of the popular vote , but still failed to elect a single Member of the Legislative Assembly -LRB- MLA -RRB- .
Carole James is a newcomer in the leadership role of the NDP .
She was elected in 2003 and aims to restore the party to power after they suffered an embarrassing defeat .
In 2001 , the NDP went from government to opposition with only two seats .
A special election raised the expectation of change and voter dissatisfaction when the ruling Liberals were unable , despite high-profile campaigning , to prevent a demoralizing defeat in favour of the NDP candidate .
This brought the party up to 3 MLAs .
Pundit view of the debate was split on Carole James 's best approach ; an aggressive approach might win enough interest and respect to gain enough seats to form a government - or backfire and push disaffected voters toward both opponent 's parties , while a firm but softer stance would suggest acceptance of the position as opposition with an expectation to pick up about 15 seats in the assembly .
The NDP is not the old guard of B.C. political parties , and only formed in 1961 though it traces its lineage back to 1933 .
It has led the province on multiple occasions in the 1970s and 1990s .
However , a series of leadership scandals and the FastCat Fiasco led to the crushing defeat at the hands of the B.C. Liberals in 2001 .
Gordon Campbell , the Premier of British Columbia , has the most to lose in such an event and would likely have preferred not to attend at all .
An experienced rhetorician with both long service in the Legislative Assembly and in politics in general , he also heads the party which revived itself from obscurity during just such a debate in 1991 .
Described as a small-c conservative in the nature of Margaret Thatcher , his party 's dominance in the assembly did not allow him the confidence to actually present a budget the Liberals had been talking about , and making promises on , for months .
One of the oldest parties in the province , the B.C. Liberals are independent of the national Liberal party and its policies .
They are a right-of-centre party , being socially moderate and fiscally conservative .
The party was in decline for most of the last half of the past century .
However , it made a remarkable recovery during the 1990s due to the dissolution of the Social Credit Party .
It was greatly helped by its social conservatism and a series of leadership and financial scandals in the NDP .
Capitalizing on a split in the ruling party , the Liberals took power in the 2001 election with 77 of 79 assembly seats .
With tight moderation and a constrained debate format of questions and answers , rebuttals , and open floor debate , the entire event was surprisingly civil as each candidate tried to push the others into social gaffes .
The candidates managed to stay on message throughout , though the discourse occasionally broke into the almost spontaneous and provided some of the liveliest discussion in what has begun to seem like a dull campaign , at least by B.C. standards .
Leading the way into the fray , Campbell pointed to the NDP for leaving the economy and infrastructure of the province in a shambles .
`` British Columbia became a have-not province , '' he repeated several times .
James hammered back , focusing on broken campaign promises and trust issues .
When Campbell pointed to the successes of his party in office , she dismissed the claims .
`` We see Mr. Campbell taking credit for things that he had nothing to do with , high commodity prices and low interest rates . ''
In the enviable position of watching her opponents digging into each other and not sparing much effort on the Greens , Carr was free to criticize both parties .
`` The gap between the rich and the poor has grown to be the biggest in Canada and that 's a shameful record , '' she said to Campbell .
When James pointed to the privatisation of Healthcare under the Liberals , Carr cut her dead with `` And who started the move to privatisation ?
It was the NDP who started that move . ''
The debate , broadcast live by three stations , did not have any clear winners or losers .
Macleans magazine reported that Campbell survived being double-teamed by the other parties , yet he also seemed unable to meet James 's challenges or respond to Carr 's inquiries with direct answers .

May 8 , 2005
Protesters gathered in Amsterdam , Maastricht , and several other cities in The Netherlands to protest a visit by the United States President , George W. Bush .
As many as 2,000 people gathered in Amsterdam 's Museum Square , voicing their discontent with the war in Iraq .
Many protesters consider Bush personally responsible for the torture in Abu Ghraib prison and human rights violations in Guantanamo Bay .
Their arguments are based on documentary evidence such as the FBI email showing that Bush directly ordered what might be described as torture -LRB- hoods , sleep deprivation -RRB- -LSB- 1 -RSB- .
A large number of protesters carried signs that read `` George W. Bush : Warcriminal . ''
More than 150 people attended a demonstration in Maastricht , many going to Beek Airport to give Bush an unpleasant and noisy welcome .

May 13 , 2005
, \ nUnited States Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld announced the closure of 33 major military facilities in 22 states around the U.S. .
When word of the plans to shuffle facilities was released , closing some and expanding others , many community leaders shuddered .
Cities like San Antonio , Texas , a town built on the back of military establishments , fear the possible economic effects .
If the city 's bases were closed , the city and local businesses could be crippled .
The current announcement , however , benefits the city of San Antonio with the expansion of Ft. Sam Houston , despite the closure of two air bases .
Groton , Connecticut , on the other hand faces the closure of a submarine base .
Senator Joseph Lieberman -LRB- D-Conn -RRB- claimed the closure was `` cruel and unusual punishment . ''
His state would lose 7,133 military jobs as well as 1,041 civilian jobs .
Many communities around the nation stand to lose , while others could end up winners , as a result of the announced re-shuffle .

May 14 , 2005
Arab news channel Al Jazeera announced Saturday that it plans to open an English-language channel called Al Jazeera International at the beginning of 2006 .
The project fits in with the robust growth and in-your-face style of the original channel , but faces significant challenges in the new markets .
Al Jazeera 's confrontational approach to news has earned it enemies in every government in the Middle East .
Its independence has caused the Iranian government to close its Tehran bureau for covering ethnic riots near the border with Iraq .
Al Jazeera has also earned the enmity of Washington D.C. , where the Bush administration regularly complains about their coverage .
Al Jazeera offices were also hit by U.S. weapons in Kabul , Afghanistan , and Baghdad , Iraq , although the U.S. military insists they were accidental targets .
The biggest issue for Al Jazeera is a lack of distribution .
All major news services in North America , a prime market for the English language channel , struggle to gain and maintain distribution .
The new channel has named its management team : Al Jazeera has been expanding in other markets as well .
It opened a channel last month which covers news events without a presenter or commentary .
It also have a sports channel and plans for a children 's channel .

June 5 , 2005
Italian firefighters say a truck burst into flames inside the 13 km -LRB- 8 mile -RRB- Frejus tunnel under the Alps .
Two bodies have been recovered from the tunnel between Italy and France .
According to the Italian news agency ANSA , the truck which caught fire was carrying tires , and the fire has spread to three other vehicles : another truck , loaded with paint , a van of the French tunnel company and a car .
For much of the night , Italian emergency services were being held back about a mile from the fire by the intense heat , but the fire has now been put out .
Several vehicles are thought to be still in the tunnel .
Police are trying to contact a group of people who escaped on foot in order to assess whether people were trapped inside .
French officials have stated that all people who made it to safety alcoves -LRB- ventilated shelters directly linked to a fresh air shaft -RRB- on the French side of the tunnel have been safely rescued .
The Italian side of the tunnel is now being searched for bodies by the Italian emergency services .
The tunnel has a 0.54 % uphill gradient going from the French to the Italian side .
Heat and smoke generally escaped on the Italian side , as the uphill tunnel acted like a chimney that sucked in cold fresh air from the French side .
Val Fréjus is a city on the French side of the border , in the Rhône-Alpes département .
A fire in a similar tunnel under the Alps -LRB- the Mont Blanc Tunnel -RRB- reached temperatures of 1,000 ° Celsius and killed 39 people in 1999 .

June 6 , 2005
Brazil -- The Brazilian Deputy Roberto Jefferson told the Brazilian newspaper Folha de São Paulo that the ruling Workers ' Party -LRB- PT -RRB- has paid Brazilian deputies 30 thousand Brazilian Reals -LRB- US 12 thousand -RRB- each , every month .
Deputy Jefferson is the President of the Brazilian Labour Party -LRB- PTB -RRB- and he is accused of directing a corrupt scheme that involves the Brazilian postal service .
The PTB is an ally of the government .
Jefferson 's allegations increase the severe political crisis regarding the government of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva .
Lula has convened a special meeting to discuss the crisis in the government .
Because of the recent scandal Brazilian stock markets went down and the U.S. Dollar increased its value in relation to the Brazilian Real .
The Brazilian Senate and the Chamber of Deputies are discussing the installation of a special congressional commission to investigate the allegations .
The first attempt of the Brazilian government to prevent the creation of the Congress ' special commission -LRB- convincing some deputies not to endorse the commission 's creation -RRB- has failed .
Now the government is trying to stop the creation of the commission in the Senate and is lobbying against it in the Congress , trying to influence both senators and deputies .
The opposition party , PSDB , criticized recently the efforts of the Brazilian government to stop the special commission of investigation , using the influence of the Minister of the Economy Antonio Palocci .
The Workers ' Party published in its webpage a note denying Jefferson 's allegations and saying that it supports investigations by Brazilian authorities .
The Brazilian Minister Waldir Pires has said in an interview with Agencia Brasil that the denunciations of corruption are appearing more because the government is fighting against them .
He also blamed previous governments by the corruption .
In a note in the Workers ' Party website , the party accuses the former-President Fernando Henrique Cardoso government of corruption .
On April 2005 , the Mayor of Rio de Janeiro , Cesar Maia , denounced the Workers ' Party payment to deputies .
The allegations of Jefferson marks the beginnings of a severe crisis in Brazilian government .
This is the most severe crisis since the impeachment of the former President Fernando Collor de Mello in 1992 .
Politicians from the opposition said that they do n't want the impeachment of Lula , however they demand the investigation of all denunciations and that the guilty be punished .
Some excerpts of the interview of Roberto Jefferson :

June 9 , 2005
The investigations into the 1994 Rwandan genocide should be completed by the end of July , according to a spokesperson for the traditional Gacaca courts .
The courts are a form of community based justice that were set up in an attempt to deal with the nearly 100,000 people accused of war crimes .
`` Work is progressing quite fast in most places across Rwanda .
We are looking at finalizing the investigation phase by the end of July '' , said the spokesman , Innocent Musafiri .
The courts were set up three years ago , however so far their time has been taken up with trial runs .
There are 10,000 courts across the country , and they are expected to take eight years to process all accused .
Regular courts would have taken up to 100 years .
The judges are untrained citizens elected by their peers .
The 1994 Rwandan genocide was an eruption of ethnic conflict where Hutu militia , supported by the Hutu dominated government and encouraged by ` hate radio ' , attempted to ethnically cleanse the minority Tutsi .
Despite numerous warnings the international community did not take serious action to prevent the atrocities , which included hacking people to death with machetes , and forcing people into buildings that were then destroyed with bulldozers .
Estimates place the number killed at up to one million .

June 11 , 2005
The finance ministers of the G8 , the world 's eight richest countries , after years of pressure from wide coalitions of human rights campaigners , such as the Committee for the abolition of third world debt -LRB- CADTM -RRB- , have agreed to a deal to relieve the debts of 18 of the poorest countries in the world , but have not yet published the full details .
The International Monetary Fund -LRB- IMF -RRB- , the World Bank -LRB- WB -RRB- , and the African Development Fund will write off all of the money owed to them by the selected countries .
However , the Inter-American Development Bank -LRB- IDB -RRB- and the Asian Development Bank -LRB- AsDB -RRB- will `` not '' cancel debts owed to them by heavily indebted poor countries -LRB- HIPCs -RRB- such as Bolivia , Nicaragua , Honduras , Guyana , Vietnam , and Laos .
The countries to receive debt cancellation from the IMF , WB and the African Development Fund are Benin , Bolivia , Burkina Faso , Ethiopia , Ghana , Guyana , Honduras , Madagascar , Mali , Mauritania , Mozambique , Nicaragua , Niger , Rwanda , Senegal , Tanzania , Uganda , and Zambia .
The deal , devised by the United Kingdom , could potentially free up government revenue for domestic spending on things such as education and health services .
The World Bank , the International Monetary Fund and the African Development Fund will write off all of the money owed to them by the above listed nations .
A total of $ 40bn will be cleared , which will save debt repayments of $ 1.5 bn a year .
CADTM argues that this is a negligible effort by the rich countries , since $ 1.5 bn a year is extremely small compared to the $ 350bn the G8 devote to farming subsidies or the $ 700bn they spend in military expenditure each year .
Moreover , these 18 countries only represent about 5 % of the population of developing countries .
Another twenty countries may become eligible to have their debts cleared if they meet criteria decided by G8 finance ministries .
According to G8 representatives , the main criteria are the reduction of corruption and better government .
According to critics , such as the CADTM , the criteria include the privatisation of natural resources and of strategic economic sectors to the benefit of transnational corporations , higher costs of health care and education through privatisation , a rise in VAT , free flow of capital , which leads to capital leaving the country as shown by several UNCTAD reports , lower tariff protection , which leads to thousands of small and middle producers losing their livelihoods because they can not compete with imported goods .
The CADTM claims that the G8 agreement `` can solve neither the issue of the debt nor the issue of poverty since it bears on only 2 % of the external debt of developing countries '' and demand `` an immediate and complete cancellation of the public external debt of all developing countries , the burden of the debt being a major obstacle to meeting fundamental human needs . ''
Other groups , including charities , have similarly stated that the debts of 62 countries need to be cleared if the UN wants to meet its target of halving world poverty .
Fourteen of the countries to receive debt relief are in sub-Saharan Africa .
The alleviation of third world debt has been a lifelong ambition of Gordon Brown , the current UK chancellor , and he has used all of his political power and status to push for this agreement in the G8 group .

filename:<doc id="11864" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=11864" title="Canadian PM survives confidence vote"><paragraph:1_2_3_4_5_6>:SNT_LIST
June 15 , 2005
Canada 's scandal-plagued Liberal party survived a series of 15 confidence votes late last night ensuring Canadians wo n't be forced to head to the polls in a snap election this summer .
The minority government 's win came amidst uncertainty over whether backbench MPs would force an election over the contentious issue of same-sex marriage .
But Prime Minister Paul Martin has yet another hurdle to jump with a key vote on Thursday over the government 's second budget bill .
The bill is an amendment that came about as a result of a deal reached with the NDP Party in April , when the party 's leader , Jack Layton , offered to support the Liberals if they would amend the budget to cancel corporate tax cuts due to be phased in over several years .
The budget deal with the NDP outlines $ 4.6 billion in spending for infrastructure , education , foreign aid and the environment .
Martin 's government has been plagued by a sponsorship scandal over irregularities in public advertising contracts dating back to the 1990s awarded by the previous administration .

June 22 , 2005
On the same day he released his debut solo album , former Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan announced , `` I want my band back , and my songs , and my dreams . ''
Those words appeared in a full-page ad -LSB- 1 -RSB- that ran in Tuesday 's edition of the Chicago Tribune under the title , A Message to Chicago From Billy Corgan .
The alternative-rock icon also wrote , `` For a year now I have walked around with a secret , a secret I chose to keep .
But now I want you to be among the first to know that I have made plans to renew and revive The Smashing Pumpkins . ''
The group , which included guitarist James Iha , drummer Jimmy Chamberlin , and bassists D'Arcy Wretzky and Melissa Auf der Maur , last played together in 2000 .
On February 17 , 2004 , Corgan posted a bitter message on his personal blog calling Wretzky a `` mean spirited drug addict '' and blaming Iha for the breakup .
It was not clear if Corgan 's former band members knew of his plans , or who would be involved with the new group .
No other details on the plans were forthcoming from the singer , who lives in the Chicago area .

June 29 , 2005
Forward Maciej Żurawski , one of the most famous Polish footballers , accepted a contract offer from Celtic yesterday .
He is now waiting for agreement between Celtic and his former club , Wisla Krakow , where he played for nearly 6 years .
Wisła wants to receive a lump sum payment at once , but Celtic would like to pay circa 3 millions euro in installments .
Żurawski , the star of Polish national football team , rejected an offer from Trabzonspor .
The Turks had offered approximately 100 thousand euro more for him .
If he had accepted this offer , he would play alongside former Wisła 's player , Mirosław Szymkowiak .
Many people , including former Celtic star Dariusz Wdowczyk , believe he made the right decision .
He will play for a club with a long history of international presence , and with chances of appearing in the Champions League this year , something Żurawski 's expressed as his dream .
Celtic will be Żurawski 's fourth club in his career .
He has played for Warta Poznan , Lech Poznan , and for Wisla .
He will earn over € 700 thousands per year .

`` Currently , the United States has no specific , credible information suggesting an imminent attack in the United States , '' says Chertoff .
The United States Coast Guard , part of the Department of Homeland Security , has alerted stations in high-risk areas to stand 24/7 patrols .
In Washington , Capitol Hill police announced plans to search buses , tour vans and larger vehicles traveling on the roads leading to the Capitol .
In San Francisco today , local police stood guard at Muni and BART stations .

July 11 , 2005
On Friday , Brazilian police officers detained a leader of the Workers ' Party at Airport of Congonhas in Sao Paulo .
He tried to board carrying R$ 200,000 -LRB- 83,744.90 USD -RRB- and US$ 100,000 undeclared in cash .
The money was hidden in his bag and in his underwear .
The man who was detained is José Adalberto Vieira da Silva , 39 , Organization secretary of the Workers ' Party from Ceará and the adviser of state deputy José Nobre Guimarães .
Guimarães is the brother of José Genoino , President of the Workers ' Party , the ruling party in Brazil .
José Adalberto , was detained on Friday , at about 11 a.m. -LRB- local time -RRB- when he was boarding to Fortaleza .
Authorities detected through the airport 's X-rays equipment that a great quantity of money was inside Adalberto 's bag .
After the bag was opened , the officers discovered R$ 200,000 -LRB- 83,744.90 USD -RRB- in cash .
The authorities took José Adalberto to another room in the airport .
After searching in his clothing , police officers discovered US$ 100,000 hidden in Adalberto 's underpants .
The authorities charged José Adalberto for boarding without notification with more than R$ 10,000 -LRB- 4,187.25 USD -RRB- , which is forbidden by Brazilian laws .
Adalberto is currently being held in São Paulo , awaiting trial .
The deputy José Nobre Guimarães denied any involvement in this case and fired José Adalberto Vieira da Silva .
José Genoino , the Worker 's Party President , resigned on Saturday -LRB- 9 -RRB- .
Mr Tarso Genro , the current Minister of Education , left the ministry and assumed the Worker 's Party Presidency .
José Genoino is the third official to resign since the Brazilian deputy Roberto Jefferson began to give details about an alleged huge corruption scheme involving politicians from the government , the Worker 's Party , the Brazilian Agency of Intelligence -LRB- Abin -RRB- and public and private enterprises .
On July 5 , the party 's treasurer Delubio Soares and the general-secretary Silvio Pereira had resigned .

July 12 , 2005
Dramatic developments today have revealed new information about last Thursday 's bomb attacks on London .
One person has been arrested after a series of raids in Leeds .
The four men alleged to be responsible for the bombings travelled by train from Leeds to King 's Cross on Thursday morning , where they were seen on CCTV at 8.30 am .

One of the three from Yorkshire was reported missing by his family at 10 pm that evening .
Three of them then boarded underground trains .
The fourth alleged bomber - the man reported missing from Leeds - died onboard the bus , but there are no clear reasons for why he did not follow the same pattern as the others .
It has been confirmed that at least three of the four bombers died in the blasts .
Forensic evidence and items belonging to all of the men were found in the debris of the target vehicles .
Police also found a car at Luton train station , which is on the route from Leeds to King 's Cross .
A series of controlled explosions was carried out on the car .
It is understood that one of the bombers drove equipment in the car to Luton , while the others travelled by train .
Materials used to make explosives were also found at one of the houses in Leeds .
A second car was found on the property of a recovery company in Leighton Buzzard ; it had been ` routinely recovered ' from Luton train station on the evening of Tuesday , July 12 .

July 17 , 2005
The death toll from a suicide bomb attack in Musayyib , Iraq has risen to 98 .
A suicide bomber attacked a fuel truck arriving at the gas station in the Iraqi town overnight on July 16 , running up to the truck and detonating his explosives .
The huge blast which followed killed many locals at a crowded vegetable market near the local Shi'ite mosque .
Early reports put the number of dead at between 50-60 , but this has risen as the full scale of the carnage has become apparent .
Hospital sources said they were treating 75 wounded , including 19 in a serious condition .
The attack in Musayyib was the deadliest suicide attack since 125 people were killed in February in nearby Al Hilla .
` This is a black day in the history of the town , ' the Musayyib police chief , Yas Khudayr , said .
Musayyib lies south of Baghdad , in the center of a dangerous area known as the ` triangle of death ' , where patrolling US forces are subject to constant attack from Iraqi resistance forces .
Angry crowds protested on Sunday against the local authorities , which they blamed for not doing enough to prevent the attack .
According to one protester , police had placed a ban on trucks entering the town , but had allowed the fuel tanker through .
During a parliamentary session in Baghdad , the government was blamed by politicians for the dire security situation .
Calls were made for local militia to be formed to replace the police and soldiers who had failed to protect Iraqis .

July 29 , 2005
Michael Shields , an 18-year old Liverpool Football Club supporter , has been jailed for the attempted murder of a Bulgarian barman , despite another man from Liverpool admitting full responsibility .
Shields , 18 from Wavertree was charged with the attempted murder of Martin Georgiev , 25 , after being accused of throwing a brick at the barman 's head in the city of Varna , where he was celebrating Liverpool football club 's win over AC Milan in the final of the Champions League in Istanbul in May .
Before being charged , a 20 year old man from Anfield came forward and claimed responsibility for the attack - Graham Sankey , made a statement through his lawyer David Kirwan .
Mr Kirwan said : `` Graham believed the case against Michael would either be thrown or adjourned after he came forward to make his confession . ''
Despite the confession , Shields was convicted of attempted murder .
Shields ' uncle , Joey Graney , was in court when the sentence was passed and said : `` Michael was sobbing .
He 's an 18-year-old lad , quiet as a mouse , on his own , going back to a Bulgarian jail .
What 's he going to do ?
As far as the Bulgarians were concerned , a local lad had been attacked and they wanted their scapegoat .
They did not care that Graham Sankey has confessed to carrying out the attack .
They just tossed that aside . ''
The family have said they will do everything in their power to clear Michael 's name .
Meanwhile , Liverpool Riverside MP Louise Ellman , has backed the family 's campaign calling the incident a `` travesty of justice '' .
`` Graham Sankey has admitted he was guilty of the crime that Michael Shields is now convicted of , but he did so in a way that was inadmissible to the Bulgarian court , '' added Mrs Ellman , who is planning to speak to his defence team .
A British Foreign Office spokesman said it could not comment on the verdict but said it would continue offering consular help to Michael Shields .
Bulgarian government officials have since agreed to begin the process of releasing Michael Shields , in exchange for the arrest of Graham Sankey .
The development came after long-time justice campaigner Stephen Jakobi held closed talks with Bulgarian ambassador Lachezar Matev at the Bulgarian Embassy in London .
Mr. Jakobi announced that Michael could be free in the next `` few months '' .
`` It 's been a good day and we have achieved an important breakthrough .
`` We have got an agreement with the Bulgarian government that they are going to take up our proposed course of action - that is issuing an arrest warrant for Graham Sankey .
`` The government is independent of the judiciary in that country but they can hold talks with them to get the ball rolling as soon as possible .
`` The arrest warrant will means the extradition process will begin . ''
Home Secretary Jack Straw has also agreed to meet with Shield 's family to discuss the situation with them .

July 22 , 2005
Turner Prize winning artist Wolfgang Tilmans has donated an image to Quaker Social Action -LRB- QSA -RRB- which has been used for their first ever greeting cards .
Wolfgang said , `` Being an occasional attender and in the process of learning more about Friends , I 've been impressed with the Quaker tradition of putting one 's beliefs into action .
Groups like Quaker Social Action are living testimony to that practice .
There is a direct connection between spiritual and social activity , that serves us as a constant reminder to live in the Here and Now .
Not all of us are able or willing to commit time to social issues , others can or want to commit only money or support ; both are essential to those helping and to those in need .
That 's why I decided to support QSA . ''
Judith Moran , QSA Director followed , `` We are extremely grateful to Wolfgang , not only for donating the image but for his support in producing the card , we think it looks wonderful ! ''

August 14 , 2005
U.S. airline passengers may need to brace for longer lines at security screening checkpoints as the Transportation Security Administration -LRB- TSA -RRB- announced plans to reduce the number of security screeners in US airports .
The cutbacks come despite an increased TSA budget for 2006 over 2005 and an overall increase in airport traffic .
The Portland , Oregon and Medford , Oregon airports were among the hardest-hit by cutbacks , with Portland seeing a 30 % decline in security screeners .
Travellers are advised to check with the TSA or the airport to plan for delays at check-in .

filename:<doc id="18778" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=18778" title="New record time spent in space"><paragraph:1_3_8>:SNT_LIST
August 16 , 2005
The current International Space Station commander , Russian cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev has set a new record of a total of 748 days spent in orbit -- almost 2 years , as of Tuesday August 16th , 2005 .
This outstrips the record set by Sergei Avdeyev 's missions on Mir station .
Being in space presents many health concerns -- both psychological and physiological difficulties , such as bone loss and radiation exposure .
Krikalev 's longterm experience of life in space could help to shed light on what physical and mental factors will be needed for future long-duration flights -- such as a manned mission to Mars .
University of Texas , Austin psychology researcher David Musson is studying the phenomenon of irritability , fatigue , and lack of sleep which many space-travellers experience .
He hopes to determine which mental traits will help astronauts and cosmonauts deal with or avoid these problems .
He also considers Krikalev 's experience important for understanding ways to counter the physical side effects of space-travel , stating that `` I imagine he 's gotten pretty good over time in adhering to a countermeasure programme to minimise bone mass loss '' .
Krikalev and his American counterpart John L. Phillips are due to return to Earth on 7 October 2005 , but not before celebrating Krikalev 's 47th birthday in orbit .
They are also expecting to perform two spacewalks .
The first of these EVAs is intended to move equipment , install a television camera , and replace experiments .

August 17 , 2005
In Crawford , Texas , anti-war protesters led by American Cindy Sheehan , mother of a fallen soldier , have found a new place to demonstrate .
`` A kind gentleman from down the road , closer to the Bush ranch , has offered us the use of his property , '' said Sheehan to the reporters , as the camp prepared a move to private land .
The property owner , U.S. Army veteran Fred Mattlage , said , `` I just think people should have a right to protest without being harassed , and I 'm against the war .
I do n't think it 's a war we need to be in . ''
Sheehan continued to tell the reporters , `` He offered it because he heard about the shots fired at us the other day and he did n't think that was right .
He happens to be the third cousin of the person that fired the shots and so he came down and he said he supports us 100 percent . ''
The `` shots fired '' were those of nearby resident Larry Mattlage , whose land borders the protesters at their current location .
After complaining about the proximity of the protesters , he fired a shotgun twice into the air Sunday - in order to prepare for duck hunting season , he said .
Mattlage says at no time was he ever threatening the protesters with his shots .
Not all Americans agree with Mrs. Sheehan 's position .
On Monday , a man was arrested and charged with vandalism of Camp Casey 's memorial for troops lost in Iraq .
Around 10 pm the previous night , authorities say the accused used his pickup truck to run over hundreds of small wooden crosses bearing names of U.S. soldiers killed in Iraq .
In comments to the press , Bush offered sympathy to Sheehan , `` I sympathize with Mrs. Sheehan .
She feels strongly about her -- about her position .
And she has every right in the world to say what she believes . ''
, he said .
However , he has still declined to meet her .
`` I think it 's important for me to be thoughtful and sensitive to those who have got something to say . ''
Bush told reporters , `` But , I think it 's also important for me to go on with my life , to keep a balanced life . ''
Others have commented that Sheehan is being used by those with their own agendas , `` What started out as a grieving mom that we all sympathized with has now turned into ... an orchestrated far-left campaign , '' commented Greg Mueller , a conservative public-relations executive .
A former FBI special agent , Rowley , and Becky Lourey , whose son was killed in Iraq , will leave for Texas on Thursday and camp at the site for a few days .
Rowley said , `` It puts a human face on this issue ; many people , if they do n't have a personal connection to the troops , it 's so easy for this to become a discussion that lacks seriousness and urgency .
I think it 's good to show that there are real people that are being affected . ''
`` Our children are dying and I think it 's time to go support Cindy and see if Bush will come out and we can say , ` President Bush , what is the mission exactly ? '
, '' Becky Lourey added .
`` Truth has been shifting all around and I think we need to rejoin the world community and not occupy another nation . ''
Lourey said .
Sheehan wants the withdrawal of all troops from Iraq .
President Bush claims that leaving Iraq now would n't be helpful for Iraqis or Americans , but only for terrorists .

filename:<doc id="19035" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=19035" title="Former rebel becomes President of Burundi"><paragraph:1_4>:SNT_LIST
August 19 , 2005
Pierre Nkurunziza , leader of the former rebel group CNDD-FDD , has been elected unopposed as President of Burundi by the country 's Senate and National Assembly .
The CNDD-FDD had won landslide victories in communal and national elections earlier this year , the first since the 1993 assassination of President Melchior Ndadaye plunged Burundi into more than a decade of ethnically-charged civil war .
Nkurunziza replaces Domitien Ndayizeye , who had served as head of a transitional government since 2003 .
One key challenge will be to resolve ongoing tension between the country 's Hutu and Tutsi ethnic groups .
More than 300,000 people , mostly civilians , have been killed since 1993 .
Burundi 's Tutsi-dominated army is believed to have killed thousands of Hutu civilians during the ten-year civil war , while Nkurunziza 's own group , CNDD-FDD , has been accused of deliberately killing Tutsis .
The extremist group Palipehutu-FNL continues to stage attacks , with this week seeing the first anniversary of the Gatumba massacre , in which more than 150 Congolese Tutsi refugees were killed .

filename:<doc id="20503" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=20503" title="Tempers flare over New Orleans tragedy"><paragraph:1_6_8_12_16>:SNT_LIST
September 4 , 2005
The handling of the devastation left by Hurricane Katrina , considered by many to be inadequate , has prompted scathing criticism of American politicians .
President Bush was criticized for verbally `` pandering '' to public opinion , while little is done about the tragedy .
In a WWL radio interview , New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin called for a `` moratorium on press conferences '' and said , '' -LSB- The government is -RSB- feeding the public a line of bull , and they are spinning , and people are dying . ''
The mayor has since apologised for these remarks .
However , the mayor did not address his own alleged failure to evacuate his citizens when he reportedly left hundreds of city-controlled buses idle .
Malik Rahim , a recent Green Party candidate for New Orleans City Council , describes the poor organization as criminal , and called for his party to come help when the federal government would permit it .
Grammy award-winning rapper Kanye West created controversy when he said `` George Bush does n't care about black people '' and that `` America is set up to help the poor , the black people , the less well-off as slow as possible '' in a telethon for victims of Hurricane Katrina .
Onsite television news reporters have also levied very harsh criticism against the politicians whom they were interviewing .
Anderson Cooper -LRB- CNN -RRB- took Sen. Mary Landrieu -LRB- D. , Louisiana -RRB- to task for her detachment -LRB- WMV , trancsript -RRB- .
Andrea Mitchell -LRB- MSNBC -RRB- , Bill O'Reilly -LRB- FOX -RRB- , Geraldo Rivera -LRB- FOX -RRB- , Scarborough -LRB- MSNBC -RRB- , Shepard Smith -LRB- FOX -RRB- , Robert Siegel -LRB- NPR -RRB- , and Paula Zahn -LRB- CNN -RRB- have also harshly criticized their interviewees -LRB- WMV -RRB- .
One broadcaster bitterly exclaimed `` The only difference between the chaos of New Orleans and a Third World disaster operation , was that a foreign dictator would have responded better . ''
In a press release issued September 3rd , 2005 , Democratic Senator Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana claims that President Bush staged a photo opportunity by having rescue equipment quickly moved into the background during the event .
Senator Landrieu claims the equipment was dispersed elsewhere the next day .
Landrieu says in her press release , '' ... we witnessed a hastily prepared stage set for a Presidential photo opportunity ; and the desperately needed resources we saw were this morning reduced to a single , lonely piece of equipment .
The good and decent people of southeast Louisiana and the Gulf Coast -- black and white , rich and poor , young and old -- deserve far better from their national government ... '' The breached levee was closed on Monday by a sequence of dump trucks building a narrow pathway across the gap toward helicopter-dropped sandbags .
Some responses , however , have concerned themselves not with criticizing the response , but praising the hurricane itself .
The American Family Association 's Agape Press published praise for the hurricane 's destruction as an instrument of God 's mercy , in that it `` wiped out rampant sin '' .
Rev. Bill Shanks , pastor of New Covenant Fellowship of New Orleans , said `` God simply , I believe , in His mercy purged all of that stuff out of there -- and now we 're going to start over again . ''
`` New Orleans now is abortion free .
New Orleans now is Mardi Gras free .
New Orleans now is free of Southern Decadence and the sodomites , the witchcraft workers , false religion -- it 's free of all of those things now , '' Shanks says .

filename:<doc id="21377" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=21377" title="US FEMA aid site only supports Windows with Internet Explorer"><paragraph:1_3_6_9>:SNT_LIST
September 8 , 2005
The US Federal Emergency Management Agency -LRB- FEMA -RRB- website -LRB- for requesting disaster aid -RRB- is only functional for applicants using the latest version of the Internet Explorer web browser on the Microsoft Windows operating system .
Users with other web browsers , such as Netscape , Opera , Safari , Firefox , or operating systems other than Windows , are effectively screened out of the site , which gives them a message that they need to download Internet Explorer version 6 or call FEMA at 1-800-621-3362 to register .
Relief workers are setting up many computer kiosks for evacuees to use .
These kiosks are built from donated computers , many of which are unable to run Windows and/or Internet Explorer .
Most of these kiosks use LiveCD versions of Linux , leaving evacuees unable to fill out aid forms .
A spokesperson for FEMA told `` MSNBC '' they were aware of the problem , and were trying to resolve the issue .
They were , however , unable to provide an estimate of when the problem would be solved .
Mike Quealy , a FEMA spokesperson , said the issue occurred because this tool was originally designed for in-house use by people working at the call center .
Telling the Opera web browser to spoof its user agent , by identifying itself as Internet Explorer , appears to trick the FEMA website into allowing the user to fill out the form .
Firefox users can install the Prefbar extension -LRB- http://prefbar.mozdev.org/ -RRB- , and use the `` User Agent Spoof '' dropdown to achieve the same effect .
Safari users can use the Debug drop-down menu -LRB- http://developer.apple.com/internet/safari/faq.html#anchor14 -RRB- , and use the `` User Agent '' option to achieve the same effect .
Other options are to run Windows and Internet Explorer in an emulator such as VirtualPC on the Mac or VMware on Linux .
This option is slow and requires the user to already own or purchase a license for Windows and the emulator software .
Purchasing the software can cost several hundred dollars .
Implementing a software compatibility layer , like the GPL wine project , allows the user to run certain Windows software on Linux , but still requires valid licenses for Windows .

filename:<doc id="21670" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=21670" title="Loyalist rioting erupts in Belfast"><paragraph:1_5_6_10_14_15_18>:SNT_LIST
September 11 , 2005
Rioting and disorder erupted in Belfast , Northern Ireland on Saturday because of a controversial decision to reroute the Orange Order parade .
Loyalists attacked the police and army with blast bombs -LRB- homemade grenades -RRB- and petrol bombs .
There was widespread stone-throwing , and barricades were erected on some roads that caused traffic disruptions in the city .
In some places , automatic gunfire was heard , with police returning live fire .
Half a dozen police were injured , and two men were taken to hospital -- one with a gunshot wound , and another was caught in the blast of an explosion .
The parade route was altered by the Parades Commission .
The intended path of the original parade route was through a Nationalist part of Springfield Road , with the potential to result in rioting and violence -LRB- the route would have had to pass through a 30 foot high security barrier , one of the `` Peace Lines '' .
Unionists called for the decision to be reconsidered by the Commission ; however , no change was made .
Instead of passing through Springfield Road , the Orange Order parade was required to proceed through the site of the engineering firm Mackies .
The streets of northern and western Belfast echoed with sounds of violence not commonly heard since the late 1990s and the Troubles .
Petrol and blast bombs were used by rioters , and water cannon and plastic bullets were used by police .
Several cars and a bus were hijacked , and roads were closed off by mobs of people .
A number of buildings were set alight with fire around the outskirts of the city .
Throughout the night , violence spread to outlying towns around Belfast , including Ballymena , Ballyclare , Carrickfergus and Larne .
Police Chief Constable Hugh Orde described the rioting as perhaps the worst such situation ever seen in the United Kingdom - particularly because of the use of firearms in a public order situation .
He controversially held the Orange Order responsible for the disorder , and complained about the politicians who called for people to protest .
The Rev. Ian Paisley had threatened at the time of the parade rerouting decision by the Parades Commission that it `` could be the spark which kindles a fire there would be no putting out '' .
The response of Unionist politicians has been to accuse the police of brutal and heavy-handed tactics .
Hugh Orde has praised the police for being `` heroes '' , and suggested that no other police force in the UK , Europe , and perhaps even the US has had to deal with such ferocity in a public order situation .
Unionists described the Chief Constable 's comments as `` inflammatory '' .

filename:<doc id="22266" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=22266" title="Saudi Arabia, UAE to support increasing oil production"><paragraph:1_3_4_6_8>:SNT_LIST
September 17 , 2005
Oil ministers from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates announced that both countries would support raising crude oil output quotas by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries .
The Saudi minister , Ali al-Naimi , said that rising prices were lowering world demand , and his nation ` absolutely ' backs the increase , while Mohammed bin Dhaen al-Hamli from the UAE claimed that the markets could calm on the decision .
Earlier , the OPEC cut their oil demand estimates for 2005 , saying that it will rise by only 1.7 % , compared to previous prediction of 1.9 % .
The organisation is to meet to discuss the possible increase on September 19 .
If the decision take place , the official limits will be the highest since 1987 .
Saudi Arabia is the OPEC 's biggest crude oil producer , with production of about 9.5 million barrels a day and spare capacity of approximately 940,000 barrels .
Formal daily output of whole organisation is 28 millions barrels outside Iraq , and estimated unused stocks of 1.39 million barrels .
On the London-based International Petroleum Exchange price of the Brent crude barrel fell $ 1.45 to $ 62.21 on Friday .

filename:<doc id="22367" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=22367" title="Google launches new blog search engine"><paragraph:1_4_7_8>:SNT_LIST
September 23 , 2005
In mid-September , Google launched a new search engine : Google Blogsearch .
The new search engine , whose development was announced over two years ago , allows you to search blogs by dates , date ranges , language , authors , and by the blog itself , in addition to keywords .
It is then possible to set up your own custom newsfeed with these search criteria .
Despite the features , there has been criticism related to this new engine .
One example is how their index only dates back to March 2005 .
In addition , flaws in the search algorithm may result in duplicate blog entries , as well as other `` blog noise '' to receive high results .
This new search engine was made supposedly to help compete with other search engines , such as one by Yahoo! .
`` Google Blogsearch '' has joined the group of other Google search engines , including `` Google Image '' search , `` Google Groups '' , and the famous `` Google Web '' search .

September 20 , 2005
Irvine , California -- Lightning storms moved over Southern California Monday evening and Tuesday morning .
Rain fell several times during the night , and lightning struck repeatedly throughout the region .
Citizens reported smoldering palm trees in several areas of Orange County .
In the suburban city of Irvine , darkness came early as heavy clouds blotted out the twilight .
Some of the heaviest weather came soon after , as fat raindrops fell on the city .
Lightning lit up the sky as often as every fifteen seconds , and AM radios emitted bursts of static every few seconds as lightning struck .
The storm tapered off for several hours , but peaked again shortly before 1 am ; lightning was once again seen repeatedly and power flickered several times .
The National Weather Service 's San Diego office issued an advisory warning of approaching thunderstorms ; they estimated there would be 1/4 inch of rainfall and that the storm would leave the area by Tuesday night .
Southern California rarely sees lightning ; a thunderstorm rolls through once every few years , typically due to bad weather to the south .
Meteorologists say that this storm is an offshoot of Hurricane Max , which is currently several hundred miles west of Mexico and moving away from land .

October 7 , 2005
The International Atomic Energy Agency -LRB- IAEA -RRB- , a UN agency , and its Director Mohammed ElBaradei have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for 2005 , the committee 's chairman Professor Ole Danbolt Mjøs announced today .
In the announcement , the Norwegian Nobel Committee emphasizes the role the IAEA plays in preventing military use of nuclear energy arms proliferation , and ensuring peaceful use of nuclear energy .
Furthermore , the Committee notes that IAEA 's work is in line with Alfred Nobel 's original motivation for the Peace Prize , namely the reduction of standing armies .
The committee expressed its belief that the increasing threat of nuclear arms today must be met through the broadest possible international cooperation , as exemplified in the work of the IAEA .
A spokeswoman for the IAEA , Melissa Flemming , said in Vienna : `` I never thought we 'd see this day .
This is the proudest day for the IAEA .
We are proud , astonished , elated . ''
The IAEA , headquartered in Vienna and established in 1957 , seeks to prevent nuclear proliferation and promotes the peaceful use of nuclear energy .
It is currently involved in efforts to bring DPRK -LRB- North Korea -RRB- back to the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty -LRB- NPT -RRB- regime and verifying the peaceful nature of Iran 's nuclear program .
These negotiations have been difficult , and are viewed by some -LSB- 1 -RSB- as not very successful .
The 63-year old Mohamed ElBaradei , an Egyptian-born lawyer , heads the agency since 1997 and was recently confirmed for a third term .

October 10 , 2005
Members of the Canadian Media Guild voted overwhelmingly to accept a tentative deal with Canadian Broadcast Corporation -LRB- CBC -RRB- management after a seven week lockout .
The Guild reported 3,514 ballots were cast and 88.4 per cent voted in favour of ratification during their 9 October ballot .
Most of the 5,500 unionized workers are expected to be returning to work on Tuesday .
The deal caps contract workers at 9.5 per cent of the full-time work force .
The issue of the employer insisting on a larger number of non-guild members lead the union to vote in favour of a strike in early August .
On 15 August the CBC effectively shut down its English-language programming outside of Fredericton , New Brunswick , and its French language service outside of Quebec .
The negotiated agreement includes an individual signing bonus of $ 1,000 , as well as allowing for wage increases of 12.6 % over the life of the contract -LRB- over the complete period of the contract , to 31 March 2009 . -RRB-

October 21 , 2005
The Wikimedia Foundation , the mother organization of the popular Wikipedia encyclopedia , and Answers.com , a search engine company , announced a new partnership .
This partnership will lead to the development of a special edition of Answers.com 's `` 1-Click Answers tool '' , called `` 1-Click Answers , Wikipedia Edition '' .
The advertising revenues from this software will be split with the Wikimedia Foundation .
It will be linked from the English Wikipedia Tools page for a 60 day trial beginning in 2006 .
Jimmy Wales , president of the Wikimedia Foundation , said he was `` pleased to partner with Answers.com , encouraging software that improves access to Wikipedia . ''
Bob Rosenschein , Answers.com 's founder and CEO , told the media that Wikipedia is `` the most dynamic of over 120 content sources found in Answers.com '' .
The Wikipedia community is actively discussing the partnership .
`` One of the potential problems with encouraging software-based and third party uses of Wikipedia 's content is that it could divert people from the site , '' one user remarked .

October 27 , 2005
Police arrested over two dozen anti-war protesters for demonstrating without a permit in front of the White House in Washington , DC on Wednesday .
The rally consisted of protestors organized in a `` die-in '' , appearing to be deceased .
The peace rally was performed shortly after reports that the death toll for U.S. soldiers serving in Iraq reached 2,000 .
The left-leaning "MoveOn.org '' led a national campaign to galvanize anti-war vigils .
Organization members on their e-mail lists received a notice Wednesday that read : `` Dear MoveOn member , Yesterday we reached the sad milestone of 2,000 killed in Iraq .
But for the most part , the national media are ignoring this tragic milestone . ''
Phyllis Bennis of the Institute for Policy Studies said that changes in U.S. public opinion are showing signs that peace activists are `` beginning to give voice to the majority in this country . ''
Among those arrested was activist Cindy Sheehan .
She was arrested for the same offense in another anti-war demonstration just last month .

November 1 2005
The United States Senate met behind closed doors on Tuesday under Democratic pressure to investigate the intelligence that led to the war in Iraq .
The rare parliamentary rule invoked by the Democrats forces the removal of all media , staff , and tourists from the chamber .
Congress will stop working on legislation temporarily .
Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid stated that a private session was justified by the fact that the indictment of Lewis Libby showed how the administration manipulated the intelligence in order to justify the War on Iraq .
President Bush made his case on the war by citing U.S. intelligence showed Iraq with the possessions of weapons of mass destruction .
Both the U.N. weapon inspector team and the U.S. military found no such weapons .
Conservatives saw the unusual maneuver as a ploy to distract the public from President Bush 's recent nomination of Samuel Alito to the Supreme Court and dismissed the investigation , which has been in the news over the past several days with the resignation of Vice President Cheney 's aide Scooter Libby after the disclosure that Libby lied under oath about leaking information that would provocate war between Iraq and the U.S.

filename:<doc id="25855" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=25855" title="UN pressures Iran with nuclear compromise plan"><paragraph:1_2_3_6_9>:SNT_LIST
November 13 , 2005
Mohamed el-Baradei , head of the U.N. watchdog group International Atomic Energy Agency -LRB- IAEA -RRB- , may go directly to Tehran some time this week with a compromise plan to reduce the possibility that Iran may make use of its uranium enrichment program to produce nuclear arms .
Under a compromise plan negotiated last week between the EU-3 -LRB- consisting of France , Germany , and the United Kingdom -RRB- and the United States , a loose agreement was reached where the final stages of nuclear enrichment within Iran , uranium hexafluoride -LRB- UF6 -RRB- gas , would be transferred to Russia .
Gholamreza Aghazadeh , who heads the nuclear program in Iran , rejected the proposal on Saturday , insisting that the uranium enrichment program must be carried out in Iran .
The rejection came after a meeting with Russian foreign minister of affairs Igor Ivanov .
Iran 's foreign ministry spokesman , Hamid Reza Assefi , denied the meetings were to develop a nuclear program partnership with Russia that specifically relates to the new IAEA proposal .
The IAEA board will meet on November 24 , when they may decide to refer Iran for possible economic sanctions before the U.N. Security Council .
The U.S. secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , has distanced the United States from the short deadline for Iran to conform to the new plan .
A state department spokesman , Adam Ereli said on Thursday that , `` The secretary does not conduct diplomacy by deadline . ''
Enriched uranium can be used to generate energy or to make nuclear weapons , a capability Tehran claims is their right to pursue for the peaceful purposes of generating electricity .

November 20 , 2005
The carcasses of two deer , a coyote , and a possum were dumped in the Delta Gamma Iota fraternity house on the campus of Ball State University in Muncie , Indiana on November 10 .
The dead animals were apparently placed in the house while members slept .
A repairman discovered the prank while working in the house 's kitchen .
Members left the house for at least a day while the animals were removed and the house was disinfected by the Delaware County Health Department .
The fraternity house is located off-campus and is recognized by Ball State -- the DGI house is unaffiliated with the intra-fraternity council , however .
The animals were apparently `` roadkill '' -LRB- struck and killed by automobiles on the road -RRB- .
The Indiana Department of Natural Resources is investigating the incident due to the use of deceased animals in vandalism .

November 19 , 2005
In a joint agreement by Australia and the United States , the U.S. Air Force will begin regular strategic bomber aircraft training in the Northern Territory early next year .
At the recent high-level AUSMIN talks between the U.S. and Australia it was announced that the strategic bomber training program would involve B-52 and B-1 bombers and the B-2 stealth aircraft .
Under the new arrangements aircraft would fly direct from the United States for bombing operations at the Delamere Air Weapons Range situated about 130 km south-west of Katherine in the Northern Territory .
Delamere is a 211,000 ha bombing range used regularly by the Royal Australian Air Force -LRB- RAAF -RRB- for dropping live weapons .
The Darwin RAAF base would also be available for the bombers to land and refuel if necessary .
The planes will fly to the Northern Territory from the U.S. Pacific Island base of Guam .
Defence Minister Robert Hill says Australia is helping in the rebalancing of America 's military forces in Asia .
Senator Hill said strategic bomber training had been conducted some time ago and that the U.S. had now asked Australia whether it could be resumed .
`` We have said we are happy to assist , '' Senator Hill told reporters .
Mr Hill said some of the aircraft may not even touch down in Australia , while others will land at the Darwin RAAF base .
The bombers will fly from the major US base on the Pacific island of Guam .
`` It may be aircraft that come down to Australia from a considerable distance and use our bombing ranges and then return without landing , '' he said .
`` There will also be occasions when the aircraft will land and utilise facilities at Darwin .
We think it 's just another example in which we can be helpful to our ally '' .
Labor 's opposition defence spokesman , Robert McClelland , also supports the program .
`` It 's very important to our long-term security that we support the United States alliance as a partner - not being dictated to in anyway - but as a partner , '' he said .
`` It is quite reasonable we provide a significant resource we have in Australia , which is open space , to develop the technologies and the skills . ''
But the Australian Greens are outraged by the project , saying there has been no consultation in the Territory .
`` The Australian Government more and more is allowing the Americans to view this country as the 51st state , '' Greens leader Senator Bob Brown said .
The mayor of Katherine , Anne Shepherd , also has serious concerns about the plan .
`` I know of the other accidents that have happened there when the Americans were training , '' Ms Shepherd said .
In August this year , A U.S. Marine Corps fighter jet dropped a bomb and damaged a building in an accident .
The bomb , dropped by an F/A -18 Hornet , exploded near a control tower and damaged facilities at Delamere Air Weapons Range - attached to the RAAF Base Tindal near Katherine .
At the time , Prime Minister John Howard said : `` Things like this will always happen ; we hope not very frequently and we hope not any more dangerously , '' he told Melbourne Radio 3AW in August .
`` But the idea that you can conduct any kind of military exercise without some kind of potential for mishap is unrealistic . ''
Ms Shepherd is also worried about the possible use of depleted uranium .
`` I know that they use the depleted uranium on the warheads for added penetration ... and the weapons can penetrate much more easily with the depleted uranium and I 'd be quite concerned if they use those kind of weapons , '' she said .
The Northern Territory Environment Center says it is disgusted by the announcement .
Co-ordinator Peter Robertson is alarmed about the location of the training .
`` Only a matter of 100 kilometres or so from one of the proposed nuclear waste dump sites near Katherine , and it would be extraordinarily alarming and ironic if an American B-52 bomber dropped a live bomb on top of the Commonwealth 's nuclear waste dump , '' he said .
Concerns have also been raised about the environmental impact of the training program .
Australia and the United States have agreed to work towards world 's best practice in environmental management for the combined military activities .
But Mr Robertson says world 's best practice is simply to stop doing it .
`` Not to do it in a way that puts at risk communities , the environment ... I mean the notion that there are clean green bombs that can be rained down on the Northern Territory , or any other part of the world , is an absolute nonsense , '' he said .

November 20 , 2005
One of the most important arguments in the run-up to the Iraq war made by Colin Powell in his United Nations speech and President Bush in his State of the Union address was that Iraq had an active biological weapons program and possessed mobile biological weapons labs .
According to an investigation by the Senate Intelligence Committee , the main source for this information was an Iraqi defector codenamed Curveball who was a source for the German central intelligence agency BND .
Several German intelligence officials responsible for Curveball have now told the LA Times that the Bush administration and the CIA have repeatedly exaggerated his claims and ignored warnings of the BND that the source was unreliable .
Recounting his reaction after seeing Powell 's United Nations speech one German intelligence officer said : `` We were shocked .
Mein Gott !
We had always told them it was not proven ... .
It was not hard intelligence . ''
This corroborates reporting by the German weekly newspaper Die Zeit from 2003 and 2004 based on statements of unnamed senior German intelligence officials .
Nine months earlier , in May 2002 , a fabricator warning was posted in Curveball 's file in U.S. intelligence databases .
Powell was never warned that his United Nations speech contained material that both the DIA and CIA had determined was false , even though several people present at Powell 's CIA meetings were fully aware of this .
At this time German intelligence officers would not let the CIA meet directly with Curveball , but allowed a CIA doctor to draw blood samples .
Questioning the validity of Curveball 's information in front of his CIA supervisor , the doctor was advised to `` Keep in mind that this war is going to happen regardless of what Curveball said or did n't say and the Powers That Be probably are n't terribly interested in whether Curveball knows what he 's talking about . ''
Shortly after Powell 's UN speech and several days before the invasion , United Nations weapons inspectors attempted to directly verify several key claims made by Curveball , but concluded that they were unsustainable .
The White House insisted on its WMD claims based on Curveball 's information .
Even after the invasion , when more and more of Curveball 's accounts were shown to be pure fabrication , the CIA and the Bush administration relied on Curveball 's information .
When U.S. forces discovered trucks with lab equipment and Curveball claimed that these were identical to the ones he has been reporting about , the CIA rushed to publish a White Paper claiming that these trucks were part of Saddam Hussein 's secret biological weapons program and Bush claimed publicly that `` We found the weapons of mass destruction . ''
Several days later , twelve of the thirteen WMD experts who analyzed the trucks agreed that the equipment was not suited for biological weapons production , with the only dissenting voice coming from the author of the original White Paper .
The White Paper remains posted on the CIA website to this date , and President Bush has not yet retracted his statement that Iraq produced `` germ warfare agents '' made in his State of the Union address or his postwar assertions that `` we found the weapons of mass destruction . ''

December 3 , 2005
The United States Transportation Security Administration -LRB- TSA -RRB- announced Friday that it will relax proscriptions against certain carry-on items .
Beginning December 22 , travelers flying in the United States will be allowed to carry scissors less than four inches in length and screwdrivers less than seven inches in length .
The TSA hopes that by relaxing restrictions on scissors and screwdrivers , screeners will be able to more closely guard against items such as box cutters and bomb making materials .
There have been no restrictions on items such as scissor and screwdrivers in checked luggage -- in fact , box cutters , ice axes/picks , knives , meat cleavers , razor-type blades , sabers , and swords can all be transported in checked baggage .
As part of a broader security realignment , TSA screeners will begin performing more random searches of carry-on bags , pat downs , and hand-wand searches of travelers .
`` By incorporating unpredictability into our procedures and eliminating low-threat items , we can better focus our efforts on stopping individuals that wish to do us harm , '' TSA chief Kip Hawley said .
Flight attendants and pilots largely oppose the changes in permitted items -- they maintain that the changes undermine flight security .

filename:<doc id="27400" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=27400" title="Australian researchers confirm stress makes you sick"><paragraph:1_4_5_6_7_12_14_17_19_21_23_25_27_28_30>:SNT_LIST
December 7 , 2005
Australian researchers say they have scientifically proven that stress causes sickness .
The Garvan Institute in Sydney has discovered that a hormone , known as neuropeptide Y , -LRB- NPY -RRB- is released into the body during times of stress .
Their findings show the hormone can stop the immune system from functioning properly .
`` Neuropeptide Y is one of those hormones that gets unregulated or released from neurones when stressful situations occur ... it 's known for example that it regulates blood pressure and heart rates so your heart rate goes up but it has n't been known that it actually can affect immune cells as well , '' said Professor Herbert Herzog , one of the researchers .
Herzog feels it is good to finally have proof of something people have suspected for so long .
`` Now we have proven without doubt that there is a direct link and that stress can weaken the immune system and that makes you more vulnerable when you for example have a cold or flu and even in the more serious situations such as cancer can be enhanced in these situations , '' said Herzog .
The Garvan Institute study centres on two key events that enable the human body to recognise foreign substances and control invaders .
When our body encounters a pathogen -LRB- bacteria and viruses -RRB- , the immune cells retain and interrogate suspects .
Their activation is made possible by NPY .
These cells then return to the lymph nodes , which are found all over the body , with information about the foreign invaders .
The lymph nodes are where decisions about defence are made .
`` Most of us expect to come down with a cold or other illness when we are under pressure , but until now we have mostly had circumstantial evidence for a link between the brain and the immune system , '' said lead Garvan researcher , associate Professor Fabienne Mackay .
`` During periods of stress , nerves release a lot of NPY and it gets into the bloodstream , where it directly impacts on the cells in the immune system that look out for and destroy pathogens -LRB- bacteria and viruses -RRB- in the body . ''
In the case of bacteria and viruses , TH1 cells are part of the attack team that is sent out on the ` search and destroy ' mission .
But when their job is done they need to be turned ` off ' and the immune system reset .
The same hormone , NPY , that activates the sentry cells now prompts the TH1 cells to slow down and die .
`` Under normal conditions , circulating immune cells produce small amounts of NPY , which enables the immune cells on sentry duty and the TH1 immune cells to operate - it 's a yin and yang kind of situation .
But too much NPY means that the TH1 attack is prevented despite the foreign invaders being identified - and this is what happens during stress , '' added McKay .
The impact of stress on the body has been observed in athletes .
Ph. D researcher at the University of Queensland , Luke Spence , together with the Australian Institute of Sport , studied elite and recreational athletes over five months .
They found elite athletes were more susceptible to respiratory diseases under stress .
`` A lot of elite athletes put themselves through vast amounts of physical stress in their training , but also their emotional , psychological stress of feeling the pressure of Australia on their shoulders , wanting to compete and wanting to do their best , '' said Spence .
It 's not just athletes who are prone to stress .
Pressures at work and at home may cause emotional and mental stress that can be equally damaging .
Almost a third of all work absenteeism in Australia is due to illness , costing employers over $ 10 billion a year .
`` I think it has a huge impact for the work force and also for employers - if their employees are constantly stressed , constantly under pressure , they are more likely to get sick , '' Spence said .
Further research could lead to the development of new drugs which may inhibit the action of the neuropeptide Y hormone .
Herzog warns people to minimise stress `` before '' it becomes a problem .
`` Relaxation methods like yoga will help you to prevent that but there will still be people out there that are not responding to that and treatment by interfering with the system will be important , '' he said .
`` There 's obviously some time until such a treatment will be available but this is something we will definitely work towards . ''
The Garvan research will be published in the Journal of Experimental Medicine , Volume 202 , No. 11 .

December 06 , 2005
South Korean antitrust regulators fined the Microsoft company 33 billion Won -LRB- US$ 32m -RRB- .
It also ordered Microsoft to make substantial changes to the Windows operating system .
Regulators demanded that Microsoft produce two different versions of Microsoft Windows within 180 days .
These regulations will be in effect for the next ten years , but after five years Microsoft can request a review of the market .
A Microsoft spokesman said the company would appeal the decision in court .
`` We are very disappointed with the commission 's decision , '' said Tom Burt , a Microsoft vice president and deputy general counsel .
`` Ultimately , we will file a lawsuit in Korean court challenging the decision . ''
Similarily in March of last year , Microsoft was ordered by the European Union to pay € 497 million for antitrust violations .
Microsoft was also asked to share Windows operating system code with other companies and offer Windows without the media player .
Microsoft is also appealing this ruling .

December 10 , 2005
Pakistan 's Supreme Court has extended a ban on making , selling and flying kites .
The ban , which was imposed on October 25 , has been extended until the court meets again on January 26 .
Officials claim the ban is due to injuries resulting from people using metal kite strings , and due to deaths resulting from kite flyers falling off rooftops .
Basant , a kite-flying festival , where tens of thousands of people fly kites from rooftops and sports fields , takes place in Lahore , Pakistan every February .
Hardline Muslims oppose Basant as wasteful and a Hindu festival .

December 14 , 2005
Australian Guantanamo Bay detainee David Hicks has won British citizenship , opening the door for a possible bid to have him freed from the US detention facility in Cuba .
Justice Lawrence Collins of the British High Court has overturned the British Government 's refusal of citizenship to Hicks , whose mother was born in England .
Justice Collins said the Government had `` no power to withhold or deprive citizenship '' .
Justice Collins said : `` In my view it would be improper to fail to give assistance which otherwise would have been given , simply because the claimant was believed to be involved in terrorism and has not had any previous connection with this country . ''
Hicks ' lawyer , Stephen Grosz , said the decision was a breakthrough .
He said there was now no reason why Hicks should not enjoy the same protection as the nine other British citizens released without charge from Guantanamo Bay on representations of the British Government .
The British Government has repeatedly condemned Guantanamo as an abuse of legal process .
Lawyers acting for British Home Secretary Charles Clarke immediately announced that they would take the matter to the Court of Appeal .
But Justice Collins refused the British Government a stay of his judgement , meaning that the Government is compelled to proceed with Hicks ' citizenship application .
The British Government is anxious not to award Hicks citizenship as it fears that Hicks ' reaction would be to immediately renounce his Australian citizenship .
This would make Mr Hicks the primary responsibility of the British Government , which could not then strip him of his British citizenship as it would leave him stateless .
Mr Hicks 's lawyers argue that the Australian government has refused to plead for his release and has made no attempt to prevent his trial by a US military commission .
Whereas the UK government acted to remove its citizens imprisoned at Guantánamo , and would be compelled to call for the release of Mr Hicks .
After today 's ruling , his lawyers will now press the British government to make arrangements for him to take the required citizenship oath and pledge .
They will then urge the Home Office to seek his release from the detention centre , in Cuba , and bring him to the UK .
Hicks , a former kangaroo skinner and Muslim convert was caught in Afghanistan in December 2001 .
He faces charges including conspiracy to commit war crimes and aiding and abetting the enemy , all of which he denies .
Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer says David Hicks ' citizenship is not a matter for Australia .
Mr Downer says the Australian Government is neutral about the decision and that it is a matter between Hicks and the British Government .
`` Once he is a British citizen then what the British Government does in relation to him is matter between him and the British Government - it is not a matter that will involve us and we have made that clear all along , '' he said .
Federal Opposition Leader Kim Beazley says the outcome is embarrassing and that the Government should have taken a stand in favour of a proper judicial process for Hicks .
`` That 's the position not taking a strong stand in favour of a proper judicial process puts us in . ''
Greens Senator Bob Brown implored the Federal Government not to impede Hicks 's progress to Britain .
Senator Brown is concerned the Government will lean on the British Government to appeal .
`` It 's been an affront to the dignity of Australia , not just the rights of Hicks , that for four years the Australian Government has recognised the kangaroo court system , this military commission and recognised that in Australian law , backed by the Labor Party , when the Australian courts were the right place for Hicks to be right from the outset , '' Senator Brown said .
Federal Liberal MP Peter Slipper has declared , `` he 's their problem and good riddance '' .
Mr Slipper has since claimed he was joking .
News of the ruling is still to reach Hicks but his lawyers say the Home Office must comply with it or appeal .
The British Home Office has 14 days to appeal against a High Court ruling .
Hicks 's Australian lawyer , David McLeod , says his client will remain an Australian citizen as well .

December 21 , 2005
NRMA , one of Australia 's largest insurers , has come under scrutiny following the release of a scathing report into its online smash repairs system .
The report by the New South Wales Government 's Staysafe committee found that NRMA 's online repair tendering system was `` unsafe '' .
NRMA has said it has no intention of suspending the system despite the findings .
The report , which was released yesterday found that '' -LSB- The -RSB- system of allocating damaged motor vehicles to smash repairers without the repairers physically inspecting the damaged vehicle before quoting for work ... is an unsafe system in its current form '' .
According to committee member and Port Stephens MP John Bartlett the vehicles were `` being repaired to the standard of a brick and the crumple zones at the front and rear no longer worked and all the impact was being felt in the cabin '' .
According to the report `` the system would lead to cost cutting and unsafe repair practices , with the quality of repairs lowered by encouraging smash repairers to take short cuts '' .
According to NRMA , only minor `` cosmetic '' repairs are put through the system - however often there can be further damage which is only evident after a complete inspection .
The NRMA system simply places photographs of the vehicles on its website where approved smash repairers bid to carry out repairs .
David Brown , head of claims and assessments at NRMA , said this of the report : '' -LSB- W -RSB- e totally reject the findings of the report , in fact we find the report 's fundamentally flawed with no evidence of safety issues , and -LSB- it -RSB- has been prepared without seeing the system first-hand '' .
He further added that the system would not be scrapped .

January 4 , 2006
The Australia First Party is writing to its supporters requesting that they become members in order to re-register as a political party in Australia .
Australia First is seen as a far-right wing party with nationalist ideals .
The party was founded in 1996 by Graeme Campbell a Member of the House of Representatives and the Australian Labor Party .
In 2001 , Graeme Campbell , One Nation offered to endorse him as a senate candidate in Western Australia .
He failed to be elected in the October 2001 election and has remained within the One Nation Party .
The party was de-registered by the Australian Electoral Commission in 2004 for not nominating a single federal election candidate for four years .
Recently it has been alleged that the Australia First Party and its offspring the Patriotic Youth League had been involved in organising the racial violence in Sydney in December last year .
The party denies this claiming `` There is no way a small group of young nationalists could organise 10,000 people to gather at Cronulla Beach '' .
However the party 's website does claim that `` Australian Youth And Families Should Support The Cronulla Mass Mobilisation On December 11 '' .
Once the party has been re-registered with the Australian Electoral Commission it intends to contest local government elections in the Sutherland Shire , Marrickville , Coffs Harbour and Newcastle before running for federal parliament in 2007 .
The party 's NSW Secretary , Jim Saleam said `` What 's being done in Australia now is a situation where the European identity is being deprecated further , to the point where Europeans will disappear next century '' .
`` Under certain circumstances that would be called a genocide , but it 's not , it 's called progress . ''
Mr Saleam was jailed for three-and-a-half years in 1991 for possessing a firearm and organising a shotgun attack on the home of the African National Congress Australian representative , Eddie Funde .
The party needs 500 correctly completed membership applications to apply to the AEC for re-registration .
The registration process will then take up to 12 weeks .

January 9 , 2006
Lower oil and natural gas prices and a General Motors -LRB- GM -RRB- upgrade sent the Dow Jones Industrial above the 11,000 mark for the first time since before September 11 , 2001 .
The last time the Dow was above eleven thousand was June 13 , 2001 when it closed at 11,012.40 before retreating slightly .
The Dow 's alltime record was set back on January 14 , 2000 when it closed at 11,722.98 .
The impact of the Dow even getting to 11,000 is `` psychological and hard to measure , but clearly you ca n't dismiss it , '' said Hugh Johnson , chairman of asset management company Johnson Illington Advisors .
`` If it wakes up investors then it is of some value . ''
General Motors -LRB- up $ 1.09 to $ 21.89 -RRB- was the Dow 's biggest gainer , up five percent , after Goldman Sachs raised its rating on the automaker .
Sirius Radio also added to the Dow 's gain , up nearly 2 percent -LRB- to $ 6.65 -RRB- as Howard Stern made his debut on the satellite waves .
Oil prices , although still high , fell $ 1.21 to $ 63.05 a barrel .

January 11 , 2006
The blocking of the Wikimedia project by government agencies of the People 's Republic of China has entered its tenth week .
The Wikimedia project includes Wikinews as well as other popular sites such as Wikipedia .
First instituted on October 19 , this is the third such block in China , upsetting students and researchers who say that it is having a significant impact on their ability to conduct research , and even pass civil service exams .
It is unclear why they are using Wikipedia as a sole source for research in the first place .
There is little indication of whether the block is temporary or permanent .
As with all Internet blocks instituted by the PRC , government agencies have not commented .
Wikimedia has been blocked twice in the past and Wikipedia users have speculated that the two previous blocks , both in 2004 , were due to articles on banned subjects -- such as Taiwanese independence and the Tiananmen Square Protests of 1989 .
Many users in China have been using proxy servers and other means to circumvent the block .
Hopes that the block would be quickly lifted , like the previous two times , faded as weeks turned into months .
On October 21st , a prominent Chinese Wikipedia administrator posted , '' `` If nothing goes wrong , the block should be lifted within one week . '' ''
He followed up on the 24th by saying , '' `` The block will be lifted by Wednesday -LSB- October 26 -RSB- .
According to procedure -LRB- the details of which are unknown -RRB- , after the appeal is submitted , a reply will come within 3 business days , and my appeal has already been submitted by the ISP on Friday .
My ISP has said that so far they have n't encountered a case where an appeal has failed .
This should be good news , but it 's still impossible to know the reason for the block . '' ''
Since then , there has been no reported response from government agencies .
During the first block in 2004 , users of the project petitioned their ISPs , one of which is thought to have had a role in restoring access .
The second block , slightly later in the year , was only temporary , lasting four days .
The Chinese government has an active policy of blocking websites they consider harmful .
Sites that have been blocked include foreign news sites -LRB- BBC News as an example -RRB- , information about Tibetan independence , the Falun Gong and some websites based in Taiwan .
Wikimedia Foundation maintains a group of non-profit websites dedicated to open content information that any user can edit .
It includes an encyclopedia , news , quote archives , and other information .

February 3 , 2006
Pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly and Company is currently engaged in a war of words with John Mack , editor of the monthly newsletter `` Pharma Marketing News '' .
Mack and Eli Lilly are debating the origin of the Cialis Blog , a long-running Web site containing information about the popular anti-impotence medication Cialis .
The Web site features information about Cialis ' clinical trials and commentary from Lilly ICOS executives .
Mack has suggested that Eli Lilly and Company sponsors the Cialis Blog .
However , Lilly ICOS has asserted that it has nothing to do with the Web site .
Mack disputed Eli Lilly 's version of events calling the Cialis Blog `` too far-fetched to be believed '' and an example of Lilly 's `` incredible incompetence . ''
Another blog , Envisioning 2.0 , notes that the `` Cialis blog is not endorsed by the powers that be at Lilly ICOS , according to Lilly spokesperson Kindra Strupp . ''
`` Pharmaceutical Executive '' first mentioned the Cialis blog in an October 2004 article about pharmaceutical blogging .
The author of the story assigned responsibility for the blog to Lilly ICOS without attribution .
Other bloggers have posted comments on Envisioning 2.0 and Mack 's Pharma Marketing Blog suggesting that the Cialis Web site may be unofficial .
They cite evidence from a WHOIS search indicating that Mircea Piturca of Romania apparently registered the blog .
Mack and bloggers commenting on the debate have all urged Eli Lilly to take action against the site .
They all believe it is in the company 's best interest to have the site shuttered .

February 5 , 2006
Rio Tinto Group , the world 's third-largest miner , say they will return a record annual profit of over AU$ 5.32 billion to shareholders , following surging commodity prices - doubling the group 's profit .
Earnings from operations jumped 118 percent last year .
The London-based company unveiled a net profit of 58 per cent on the previous year .
The result was boosted by increases in commodity prices driven by demand from China .
Chinese interests account for around 15 percent of Rio Tinto 's sales .
Rio Tinto 's CEO , Leigh Clifford said demand for iron ore remains strong .
Prices for the steelmaking raw material and metalshave climbed to records amid rising demand from China .
`` China clearly continues to have a major impact on what they are doing , '' said Tim Barker at BT Financial Group .
`` With commodity prices as strong as they are at the moment , and not showing any signs of a change of direction , one would think there is still room for some improvement in earnings in 2006 , '' he said .
The company produced 65 million tons of iron ore in the second half , 15 percent more than a year ago .
Rio and other miners last year secured a record 71.5 percent price increase .
Rio Tinto say they are studying further mine expansion and will invest around $ 9 billion to meet the global demand led by China .
Projects include expanding WA iron ore mines , its coal mine in NSW and copper interests in the USA .
Other investments would see the expansion of a titanium dioxide project in Madagascar and Canada , in the Cortez Hills gold venture in the USA , and in the Argyle Diamonds underground mine development in North West Australia .

March 1 , 2006
After the world 's first-ever 12 month trial of random drug testing for automobile drivers , the Victorian government yesterday introduced legislation into parliament for the testing to become permanent starting July 1 , 2006 .
The government tests targeted for the presence of cannabis and amphetamines by use of a saliva swab .
During the trial period , the presence of ecstacy was not tested , because at the time the trial period began , there was uncertainty over the accuracy of saliva tests for the drug .
The legislation comes in response to the discovery that one in 46 drivers tested were found positive for cannabis and/or amphetamines .
Victorian Assistant Commissioner of Traffic , Noel Ashby said , `` It is one in 46 drivers that we 're testing are prepared to take a risk and endanger the lives of other people and that 's really what we 're about , we 're trying to prevent people endangering the lives of others '' .
Of 13,176 tests carried out during the trial , 199 drivers tested positive for amphetamines only , 19 for cannabis alone and 69 for both amphetamines and cannabis .
Each driver who tested positive was fined at least AU$ 307 and lost three demerit points .
Police also conducted tests for ecstacy , despite being unable to prosecute those driving under the influence of ecstacy alone .
During the trial , 25 drivers tested positive to ecstacy alone and more than 200 tested positive for both ecstasy and amphetamines .
Victorian Police Minister , Tim Holding said existing penalties -- which are softer than for drink-driving offences -- were inadequate and would be toughened to ensure they reflected the seriousness of the offence .
At present , a first drug-driving offence incurs a $ 307 fine and three demerit points ; subsequent offences a $ 1227 fine and up to a six-month loss of licence .
In comparison , a drink-driving offence attracts a fine of up to $ 1200 plus disqualification from driving for at least six months and up to 10 demerit points .
Repeat drink-drivers face the possibilty of being penalised with a fine of up to $ 2500 or up to three months ' imprisonment , plus a minimum one-year loss of licence and use of an alcohol interlock device for at least six months .
Under the random roadside drug-testing system , drivers who test positive are forced off the road for 24 hours .
A second swab is then taken and sent for testing to identify the drug before penalties are issued .
Ken Ogden from the RACV said he would like to see every booze bus in Victoria be able to also operate as a drugs bus .

March 6 , 2006
Sixty percent of respondents in an international survey conducted for the BBC World Service felt that the likelihood of terrorist attacks around the world has been increased by the war in Iraq .
The international polling firm `` GlobeScan '' conducted the survey , which polled 41,856 residents of 35 countries between October 2005 and February 2006 .
Participants were asked , `` Has the war in Iraq increased , decreased or had no effect on the likelihood of terrorist attacks around the world ? ''
Fifteen percent felt that the likelihood or terrorism had decreased ; 12 percent felt there had been no effect ; and 13 percent did not answer .
Out of the 35 countries polled , only Mexico and Nigeria thought the invasion lessened the likelihood of terrorist attacks .
By contrast , 85 percent of Chinese respondents said they felt the invasion increased the likelihood of terrorist attacks .
Other questions asked in the poll found that 45 percent of respondents felt removing Saddam Hussein from power was a mistake , compared to 36 percent who felt the removal was the right decision .
The poll also found that results were split on whether the foreign troops should remain in Iraq until the country is stable : 35 percent said they believed the troops should stay , 32 percent felt the troops should pull out within a few months , and 13 percent thought that a pull-out should occur within a few months unless the government of Iraq requested them to stay .
`` It 's official .
Citizens worldwide think Western leaders have made a fundamental mistake in their war on terror by invading Iraq , '' Doug Miller , president of `` GlobeScan '' , said .
`` Short of the Iraqi government asking them to stay longer , people think the troops should leave , '' he said .
In the United States , the `` GlobeScan '' poll found that 55 percent thought chances of terror attacks were increased .
In an unrelated poll conducted in the U.S. by `` CBS News '' , only 36 percent of U.S. respondents thought `` the war is going well , '' and that 30 percent felt `` Bush was doing a good job of handling the conflict . ''
This U.S. poll also found that only 18 percent held a favorable view of Vice-President Dick Cheney .
In a televised interview with Elizabeth Vargas of ABC 's `` World News Tonight '' which aired last Tuesday , President Bush said , `` If I worried about polls , I would n't be doing my job , '' on the topic of his low U.S. approval ratings .
`` I think the American people -- I know the American people want somebody to stand on principle , make decisions and stand by them and lead this world toward a more peaceful tomorrow , and I strongly believe we 're doing that , '' he said .
`` I 've got ample -LSB- political -RSB- capital and I 'm using it to spread freedom and to protect the American people , plus we 've got a strong agenda to keep this economy growing . ''
President Bush also said that Iraqis must choose between `` chaos or unity . ''

March 4 , 2006
The legal documents discussed the legal ramifications of activist allegations that Diebold Election Systems had used uncertified voting systems in Alameda County elections beginning in 2002 .
Jones Day represented the controversial electronic voting machine manufacturer at the time .
The firm 's lawyers concluded that if such uncertified systems were used , then Diebold could be sued by Alameda County for millions of dollars .
The memos also discussed whether the California 's secretary of state had the authority to investigate Diebold .
Mr. Heller has been charged with felony access to computer data , commercial burglary and receiving stolen property .
He has pled not guilty .
Blair Berk , Heller 's attorney said , `` It 's a devastating allegation for a whistle-blower .
Certainly , someone who saw those documents could have reasonably believed that thousands of voters were going to be potentially disenfranchised in upcoming elections . ''

March 5 , 2006
Ayman al-Zawahiri , Al-Qaeda 's second in command , has released a new videotape .
In the tape Zawahiri says that Jesus and the Prophet Mohammed `` are not sacred anymore . ''
.
Zawahiri also referred to the Prophet Muhammad cartoons saying , `` they did it on purpose and they continue to do it without apologizing , even though no one dares to harm Jews or to challenge Jewish claims about the Holocaust nor even to insult homosexuals .
The insults against Prophet Muhammad are not the result of freedom of opinion but because what is sacred has changed in this culture .
The Prophet Mohammed , prayers be upon him , and Jesus Christ , peace be upon him , are not sacred anymore , while Semites and the Holocaust and homosexuality have become sacred . ''
.
In the video , Zawahiri also called for Muslims to attack the west .
He also said Muslims need to prevent the West from `` stealing Muslims ' oil . ''
. ''
-LRB- Muslims have to -RRB- inflict losses on the crusader West , especially to its economic infrastructure with strikes that would make it bleed for years .
The strikes on New York , Washington , Madrid and London are the best examples .
We have to prevent the crusader West from stealing the Muslims ' oil which is being drained in the biggest robbery in history .
Reaching power is not a goal by itself ... and no Palestinian has the right to give away a grain of the soil .
The seculars in the Palestinian Authority have sold out Palestine for crumbs ... Giving them legitimacy is against Islam . ''

March 9 , 2006
As reported on `` Wikinews '' , , a and search site frequented by a massive number of Internet users everyday , has recently been one of the targets of the 's anti-piracy campaign .
Originally starting out as an IRC indexing site in January of 2003 , isoHunt added torrent search later that year in July and has been steadily growing since .
By December , isoHunt had 16,248 torrents available .
Today that amount is around 250,000 .
isoHunt has survived while many similar sites around it crumbled , yet was operating long before the others had even been thought of .
In April of 2005 , isoHunt also gained Torrentbox after its administrator gave it to Gary Fung of isoHunt .
`` Wikinews '' interviewed Mr. Fung , the 22 year-old Canadian administrator of the sites .
`` Why did you start your site ? ''
<BR> For fun , and to learn web programming -LRB- PHP and Mysql -RRB- .
Also a web search engine for P2P networks has not been done , and would be useful .
`` I read on your site at the time , news of the MPAA 's actions hit the news , that you had not been notified , how did you find out ?
How did you react ? ''
<BR> I found out first from Mike at Slyck.com , who have received letters of the press release , along with other news outlets like CNET .
Within a few hours , all the news sites posted about it .
`` Do you feel it is appropriate for the MPAA to publicly announce that they have commenced action against your sites and others before you even receive notification ? ''
<BR> Yes , although not surprising .
Factually speaking , industry associations like the MPAA often use the threat of pending lawsuits to intimidate to-be defendants , and it serves their purpose of spreading FUD to the public at large .
`` Have you ever received a takedown notice from any company in accordance with the DMCA ? ''
<BR> At least once a day , often many times a day .
I 've lost count of how many takedown requests we 've received now , it would be at least in the hundreds , if not a thousand .
We have a thorough copyright policy outlining our stance , compliance and procedures : http://isohunt.com/dmca-copyright.php .
Some of them come back and actually thank us with satisfaction for our prompt processing .
For others , such as indie content producers for TV shows and movies , we actually talk to them about using BitTorrent to aid their distribution .
And such partnerships are in the works .
`` How do you go about dealing with them ? ''
<BR> We verify their authenticity , whether identified works are within their copyright , and disable them if found to be aiding in possible copyright infringement .
`` Do you think the service you provide is any different to that of major search engines such as Google and Yahoo ? ''
<BR> No .
We are all search engines , only designed for different markets .
`` Torrents '' for example are metadata pointers that describe and link to resources on BitTorrent swarms .
Google and isoHunt for example are different only in forms of links and types of data they index .
Both serve the purpose of organizing information on open networks on the internet -LRB- WWW and P2P -RRB- , making them useful and searchable .
According to the isoHunt website , Gary received official notification of the MPAA 's lawsuit on February 28 , 2006 .
Gary admits that he was impressed by the amount of research which was put into the suit .
He said : `` I have to say I am impressed by the depth of their legal research , evidently their lawyers have been watching us for at least a year , since we exchanged letters last year .
However , their core accusation is false .
We do NOT operate this search engine and other P2P services for the express object of infringing MPAA 's copyrights , there are many other torrents of content we index that are not owned by the MPAA , copyrighted or non-copyrighted .
We would comply with DMCA takedown requests , given sufficient identification .
Which they did not . ''

March 13 , 2006
If you thought Google Maps , Google Earth and Google Moon was enough , then meet Google Mars .
Google officially launched the new Google Mars yesterday as another add-on to Google Maps .
The service offers three different ways to view Mars : elevation , visible landscape , and infrared view .
The images come from two different NASA missions , Mars Global Surveyor and 2001 Mars Odyssey , and the data was prepared in collaboration with NASA researchers at Arizona State University .
The color-coded elevation data is a shaded-relief map taken by the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter -LRB- MOLA -RRB- on NASA 's Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft .
The visible data is made from black and white images taken by the Mars Orbiter Camera -LRB- MOC -RRB- , which is also located onboard the Mars Global Surveyor , and the infrared images were produced by the Thermal Emission Imaging System -LRB- THEMIS -RRB- on NASA 's Mars Odyssey spacecraft .
The THEMIS data is the sharpest map of Mars made so far , as it shows colder areas in darker colors and warmer regions in brighter colors , and as they are infrared images dust and clouds are transparent .
Google has added various bookmarks showing points of interest such as landings of spacecraft , locations of mountains , and craters .
The data is not currently available through Google 's Google Earth client .

March 19 , 2006
Thousands of residents are evacuating coastal areas of far north Queensland -LRB- QLD -RRB- , set to be lashed by Cyclone Larry tomorrow morning .
The Australian Bureau of Meteorology warns that the `` very destructive core of Severe Tropical Cyclone Larry , with extreme gusts up to 280 km/hr -LRB- 174 mph -RRB- should cross the coast between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m. AEST on Monday -LRB- Sunday , 2100 to 2300 UTC -RRB- .
Destructive winds are expected to commence along the coast between Ingham and Port Douglas .
Gales are already being experienced along the exposed coast in the warning area . ''
Tropical Cyclone Larry , currently building off far north Queensland , is expected to intensify before crossing the coast .
Queensland tropical cyclone warning centre spokesman Bruce Gunn says people should treat warnings very seriously .
`` This is the worst cyclone we have had for many , many years , '' he said .
The Bureau of Meteorology -LRB- BOM -RRB- says the cyclone poses a `` very serious threat to life and property '' and will now post warnings on the hour on its website .
The BOM also warns coastal residents between Cairns and Townsville of dangerous storm tide when the cyclone crosses the coast .
The bureau says the sea is likely to steadily rise up to a level which will be significantly above the normal tide , with damaging waves , strong currents and flooding of low-lying areas extending some way inland .
People living in those areas should be prepared to evacuate if advised by authorities .
Mandatory evacuations have been enforced in low-lying seafront areas , including in the Johnstone and Cardwell shires south of Cairns , which are expected to bear the force of Larry and its four metre storm surge .
Disaster coordination centres have been activated in Cairns and Townsville .
`` There have been mandatory evacuations of coastal shires south of Cairns ... and emergency shelters set up for people who feel at risk with nowhere to go , '' said a Cairns City Council Disaster Coordination Centre spokesman .
`` It 's most likely thousands of people are evacuating to avoid the high tide . ''
Premier Peter Beattie has issued a disaster declaration .
Local governments now have the power to enforce mandatory evacuations .
Queensland Education Department announced that schools in the hardest hit areas will be closed tomorrow , while flights to Townsville and Cairns have been cancelled .
State Emergency Service -LRB- SES -RRB- volunteers are doorknocking and advising residents to leave .
Bruce Gunn from the Queensland cyclone warning centre says the cyclone will coincide with a high tide .
`` We are talking seawater a couple of metres above the high-tide mark , possibly more than that , with waves on top , so this is a very serious situation we are talking about , '' he said .
Mr Gunn told the ABC that severe weather will be experienced several hours before the cyclone reaches the coast .
`` While we are saying the coastal crossing will be between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m. AEST , the few hours leading up to that will be rather bumpy -- not very nice to experience , '' he said .

March 21 , 2006
David Parker resigned today from Cabinet , a day after he resigned his position as Attorney-General and after publicity around his filing of an incorrect declaration with the Companies Office on behalf of Queens Park Mews Limited .
The declaration said that the three shareholders had unanimously agreed not to appoint an auditor for the company ; but according to `` Investigate Magazine '' , another shareholder , Russell Hyslop , had never been consulted about the matter .
Parker confesses to making a `` mistake '' over the returns .
He says when Hyslop was declared bankrupt in 1997 , he cleared it with the Official Assignee for the first two years .
He then forgot to clear on other years .
Parker was saying early this morning that he would persist in holding his other portfolios .
Knowingly authorising a false statement is an offence under the Companies Act .
The maximum penalty under section 373 -LRB- 4 -RRB- for filing a false return is a fine of $ 200,000 or five years of imprisonment .

filename:<doc id="36726" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=36726" title="New book links Bonds, Giambi and Sheffield to BALCO"><paragraph:1_3_7>:SNT_LIST
March 23 , 2006
The new book Game of Shadows : Barry Bonds , BALCO , and the Steroids Scandal that Rocked Professional Sports , by Mark Fainaru-Wada and Lance Williams of The San Francisco Chronicle , is being released today .
The authors not only implicate professional baseball celebrity Barry Bonds in the use of performance-enhancing drugs , but also say Gary Sheffield received human growth hormone and testosterone from Greg Anderson , Bonds 's personal trainer .
The book goes on to claim that Jason Giambi also took performance-enhancing drugs from Anderson .
Bonds continues to insist that he did not realize his trainer was giving him steriods .
He claimed in his grand jury testimony that he thought he was receiving flaxseed oil and an arthritis salve .
Sheffield 's response to the claims was quite simple : when asked if the allegations made against him were true , his response was `` Nope . ''
Despite the book 's accusations of Sheffield and Giambi , it centers around Bonds and the founder of the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative or BALCO , Victor Conte Jr. .
Conte is currently serving four months in prison for distribution of steriods and money laundering .
It appears that the steroid controversy concerning Bonds will only intensify as he continues to march on towards the career home runs record , one of baseball 's most sacred records .

May 20 , 2006
Moviegoers around the world are expected to queue into movie theaters during the opening weekend of the movie `` The Da Vinci Code , '' despite the disapproval of both critics and clerics .
The film , directed by Ron Howard , is an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Dan Brown , which has sold over 60 million copies worldwide .
Officials at Sony-owned Columbia Pictures , which distributed the film , expect the film to gross US$ 50 million to US$ 80 million during its first weekend in the United States , based on figures from early matinees on Friday .
`` The early matinees are very strong and extremely encouraging , '' said Steve Elzer , a spokesman for Columbia .
Outside the United States , the film is also proving controversial , as long lines formed outside theatres in China , while the movie 's release has been postponed indefinitely in India and banned outright in the Philippine capital of Manila .
`` The Da Vinci Code '' stars Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou , who respectively play a Harvard professor on religious symbols and a French cryptologist who become involved in a murder mystery revolving around the works of Leonardo da Vinci , a secret that could rock the foundations of the Roman Catholic Church if revealed , and a society formed to protect that secret .
The film was previewed at the Cannes film festival to mixed reviews , and critics have generally given the film a cool reception .
Certain thematic elements in the film and novel have caused a religious backlash , as Catholic officials call the movie blasphemous . ''
` The Da Vinci Code ' gratuitously insults Jesus Christ and the Catholic Church , '' said Vincent Nichols , the Roman Catholic archbishop of Birmingham , England .
`` It deliberately presents fiction as fact . ''
The Catholic Church in China called on its followers to boycott the film , while a Catholic lay group in the United States plan is planning rallies outside 1,000 theatres nationwide .
Francis Slobodnik , who is coordinating the campaign for the Pennsylvania-based group , called the film `` an insult directed towards God . ''

May 20 , 2006
Australian Democrats founder , Don Chipp has told patrons at the party 's national conference in Melbourne that `` the party is not only in a low position in the public esteem but it seems to be in a continuous downward spiral '' .
Chipp helped found the party in 1977 after becoming discontent with the Liberal Party .
Mr Chipp told patrons at the conference that the party has suffered recently due to public personality clashes and a lack of unity and that the 2007 election would determine the party 's future .
Mr Chipp said that the party had deteriorated over the past few years and that the party could have capitalised on public dissatisfaction with both the government and opposition , which he says is at its highest level in 30 years .
`` Why has this wonderful creation ... deteriorated to such an extent that almost all political commentators forecast its death at the election to be held next year , '' he said .
`` The voters ' disgust and resentment of the two major parties is infinitely greater than 30 years ago . ''
Mr Chipp told the conference .
The party has been in steady political decline since 1998 .
Under the Senate electoral system in Australia , at each general election only half the Senate is elected .
At the 2004 election , no Democrats were elected , leaving only the four members elected in 2001 and the lowest number of Democrat members since 1977 .
Mr Chipp urged the party to embrace change .
He said that those who do not believe they could successfully contest their seat at the next election or who were considering retiring from politics should `` resign immediately '' .
`` Perhaps all the current senators should ask themselves if they think they can personally retain their seat at the next election , '' he said .
`` If they believe they can not win , or if they decide they will not stand for the next re-election , they should give consideration to resigning from the Senate immediately , '' said Mr Chipp .
`` The Democrats are a fragile institution with few members and limited resources , -LRB- and -RRB- one must ask , ` Is it moral that a senator be allowed to sit out their term in comfort while the party disintegrates around them ? ' ''
Mr Chipp said .

filename:<doc id="41660" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=41660" title="Indian Communists protest US involvement in country's internal affairs"><paragraph:1_3_6_10>:SNT_LIST
May 26 , 2006
The Congress-Left coalition government at the Centre was asked by the Communist Party of India to advise the government of the state of Chattisgarh not to accept any offer by the U.S.A. to help combat Naxalism in the area .
The CPI also expressed concern at the fact that a foreign country was being allowed to interfere in India 's internal affairs .
The U.S embassy in India had earlier offered to help train local law-enforcement authorities in Chattisgarh and to remove thousands of land mines planted by Naxals in the area .
Reports stated that America 's offer had been `` welcomed '' by the Bharatiya Janata Party-led government in the state .
This is the first time another nation has offered to help India tackle Naxalism in the latter country .
The Communist Party of India 's Politburo reacted sharply to the offer , and condemned the Chattisgrah government for allowing foreign interference in India 's affairs without the prior consent of the Centre .
The CPI also asked the Central Government to clarify to the U.S Embassy that Washington 's involvement in India 's internal affairs was not welcome .
CPI leaders A. B Bardhan and Shamim Faizi said such meddling was not new for the US , and recalled US Ambassador David Mulford 's letter to West Bengal Chief Minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee criticising the latter 's remarks against the American interference in India 's internal matters .
The CPI had recently criticised the Centre for voting against Iran at the IAEA .
Chattisgarh is one of at least 13 Indian states combating Naxals and Maoists who claim they are fighting for the rights of the impoverished peasants in the region .
Thousands have died over three decades of violence , and the last 17 months have seen a rise in the number of attacks .
The Indian Army released a report earlier this year that showed that by 2010 , 30 % of India 's land area could become part of the `` Red-Corridor '' , which currently stretches from the Indo-Nepal border all the way down to the Southern State of Andhra Pradesh .
Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh stated last month that Naxals were a big threat to India 's internal security .

May 27 , 2006
Seniors who have n't been credited with passing the California High School Exit Exam wo n't be getting diplomas when graduation ceremonies are held next month because the First District Appellate Court wo n't hear the court case about the test until July 25 .
The attorney for the students suing to block use of the test says he still expects to prevail .
`` This case is far from over , '' said Arturo Gonzalez , the lead attorney in Valenzuela vs. O'Connell , in which Liliana Valenzuela , a Richmond High School student , and others sued to block the state 's use of the test as a graduation requirement , `` We think there is a strong chance that students in the Class of 2006 will receive their diplomas , even if it is after commencement ceremonies .
It is important that students not get discouraged .
They have to stay in school and pass their classes . ''
On May 12 , Alameda County Superior Court Judge Robert Freedman agreed with Gonzalez ' argument that the state 's use of the test as a graduation requirement was unconstitutional because poor and minority students do n't have access to equal educational resources , and therefore do n't have equal protection under the law .
He issued an injunction against the use of the test .
That injunction seemed to pave the way for those of the 47,000 seniors statewide who have n't yet passed the test , but have completed all other requirements , to receive diplomas with their classmates at upcoming graduation events .
But State Superintendent of Schools Jack O'Connell quickly filed an appeal of Freedman 's ruling and asked the State Supreme Court to issue a stay of Freedman 's injunction .
Earlier this week , the Court granted O'Connell 's request for a stay , allowing schools to deny diplomas to students who have n't passed the test .
The Court also ordered the Appellate court to hear O'Connell 's appeal of Freedman 's ruling against the test .
On Thursday , Gonzalez petitioned the Appellate Court to expedite their hearing of the case to as soon as next week , but today the court denied Gonzalez ' request and scheduled the case for a hearing on July 25 .
In an email to the James Logan Courier , Gonzalez said he thinks his case is strong enough to withstand the appeal .
`` We intend to vigorously defend Judge Freedman 's ruling , '' he said , `` The record strongly supports his decision . ''
`` If the court of appeals upholds Judge Freedman 's ruling , students in the Class of 2006 may still receive their high school diplomas , '' he said .
About 70 seniors at James Logan High School in Union City , Ca. , mostly minorities and those who are learning English , still need to pass the test .
O'Connell , an avid defender of the test , which is required by a law he wrote and championed when he was in the state legislature , said this week that he would make sure school districts knew that they had to require the test be passed in order to hand out diplomas to students .
`` I will communicate with districts today to ensure they are aware that the exit exam is a graduation requirement '' he said , `` Students who have worked hard to pass this exam will be given a diploma that signifies their mastery of essential skills in reading and math . ''

May 27 , 2006
Gang violence continued in East Timor today , despite patrols by foreign soldiers being stepped up .
There are presently 600 troops from Australia , New Zealand and Malaysia in the East Timorese capital of Dili , with that number expected to rise to 1,300 by the end of the weekend .
The East Timorese government requested international assistance on Thursday following weeks of violence .
The violence started when 600 East Timorese soldiers were dismissed from the military after claiming they had not been considered for promotion due to them being from the Western region of the country .
They also claimed that the top positions in the military had been reserved for those from the Eastern regions .
East Timorese youths are forming gangs and allying with groups of feuding police and military personnel .
There have been reports of youths patrolling neighborhoods carrying machetes , swords and knives near government buildings .
They said they were protecting the areas against `` rogue army elements '' .
As with the East Timorese military , the general population 's support is divided between the remaining army and the sacked soldiers .
The police force in the country is said to be non-existent , which is helping to fuel the violence .
Ethnic attacks are also occurring in the country .
Gangs from opposing ethnic backgrounds rampaged through the streets torching buildings and looting shops .
Tit-for-tat arson attacks by opposing factions have become common .
Speaking to Australia 's ABC Radio , a UN spokesperson said that the tension has been increasing in East Timor for sometime .
`` It 's basically pay-back time between the different groups , '' `` This is a communal dispute that 's escalated because of the overall situation , '' they said .

June 15 , 2006
The FAA has issued a license for commercial spaceflight operations to the Oklahoma Space Industry Development Authority -LRB- OSIDA -RRB- .
The OSIDA will oversee the operations of `` suborbital , reusable launch vehicles '' out of the Clinton-Sherman Industrial Airpark spaceport in Burns Flat , Oklahoma .
Testing at the spacesport is expected to begin sometime next year .
Bill Khourie , director of OSIDA said , `` This is a tremendous opportunity for Oklahoma .
The benefits are just enormous as to what can branch out from this . ''
Rocketplane Kistler , an Oklahoma-based company , has started production of spacecraft and is working on the final steps of its license applications .
Rocketplan Kistler plans on a `` fairly extensive flight test program '' in 2007 and commercial flights by 2008 .
A Texas-based company has also expressed interest in the Oklahoma Spaceport .
Other United States spaceports include California Spaceport , Mojave Airport -LRB- California -RRB- , Kodiak Launch Complex -LRB- Alaska -RRB- , Spaceport Florida , and Virginia Spaceport .
A spaceport is also planned in South New Mexico , the Southwest Regional Spaceport .

June 15 , 2006
Tobacco users are being invited by the University of California , San Francisco 's Habit Abatement Clinic to test NicVax , a new vaccine being developed by Nabi Biopharmaceuticals .
Tobacco users may be test subjects under the condition that they are at least 18 years old and willing to commit to a one-year program of injections and follow-up visits .
UCSF is one of nine testing centers .
When tobacco smoke is inhaled , the chemical nicotine enters the bloodstream .
The blood affected by nicotine eventually enters the brain , triggering neuro-receptors to react and cause addiction .
This vaccine would produce antibodies to identify the nicotine molecule and prevent it from reaching the brain .
`` With little or no nicotine reaching the brain , smoking is less rewarding .
That gives the smoker a chance to change the behavioral and social factors that also influence smoking , '' said Victor Reus , MD , principal investigator for the study at UCSF .
The antibodies of the NicVax last up to 12 months within the human body .
If a person tries to smoke months after beginning the vaccination , there would not be a typical soothing feeling .

June 26 , 2006
The Australian `` Socceroos '' had the ball more , but the more experienced `` Azzuri '' defenders created an impenetrable defence , limiting the number of Australian scoring opportunities .
This was despite the Italian team shrinking to ten men after Marco Materazzi was shown a controversial straight red card in the 50th minute .
Australia looked to have gained an advantage when Marco Bresciano surged through the Italy defence and Materazzi slid in to trip him up .
Though there was an Italy defender on Bresciano 's shoulder , Spanish referee Luis Medina Cantalejo deemed that the tackle was deliberately not aimed at the ball , and considered the foul worth more than a single yellow card .
It would not be the only disputed decision in the match .
Both sides had a number of good opportunities to score , but the shots were generally too close to the box to beat the goalkeepers .
The best save of the game was made by Mark Schwarzer from a Luca Toni effort 20 minutes into the game .
Guus Hiddink delayed making attacking substitutions against ten-men Italy likely because he expected the game to go to extra time , and so wished to keep a fitness advantage later on in the game .
Hiddink 's only substitution , John Aloisi , came on at the 80th minute , while the Italian coach Marcello Lippi had made three , including the crucial one of Totti five minutes earlier .
In the attack Totti was a straight swap for Alessandro Del Piero , a fresh pair of legs which ensured Italy were a threat on the break right until the end of the regular period of play .
It was a tactic that paid dividends in the end .
The second disputed referee decision was a penalty kick was awarded to Fabio Grosso three minutes into added time -LRB- and the last minute of game time -RRB- .
Grosso was running towards goal from out wide having avoided Marco Bresciano before being obstructed by Lucas Neill .
The central defender had fallen to the ground early and Grosso , though not tripped , was impeded and dived straight over him .
Medina awarded a penalty shot as this occurred within the penalty area .
Totti , dropped from the game in favour of Del Piero , grinned slightly as he placed the ball on the spot .
The ball was struck close to the upper-right corner of Schwarzer 's box , the goalie could do nothing to stop the ball .
It was the last kick of the game and the Italians celebrated .
The Budweiser Man of the Match was Gianluigi Buffon of Italy .
The prize was a quarter-final match against the lowest ranked FIFA team in their half of the knock-out tree , Ukraine .

June 26 , 2006
Both teams started the game knowing their round of sixteen opponents were not ranked in the Fifa top 10 and appeared determined not to make mistakes .
Tackles went in quick and hard but no side took any risks to win the game .
The statistics suggest Switzerland had more shots but they arguably were the more defensive team as they had started with one forward , Alexander Frei , whereas the Ukraine had three .
Frei 's single shot came from a first period free kick which shook Oleksandr Shovkovskyi 's lintel .
Ukraine 's forward men amassed six shots ; Andriy Shevchenko went closest on 20 minutes when his diving header came off the ground and onto the crossbar .
Ukraine did not play well and despite their more attack-minded formation were so wasteful with possession that they made statistically fewer chances than the Swiss with their 4-5-1 formation .
Switzerland had 55 per cent of the ball in the game .
From a viewer 's perspective the Mexican referee Benito Archundia was lenient with tough challenges .
A game with 44 fouls - one every three minutes - had only one yellow card .
The yellow card was awarded on the hour to Tranquillo Barnetta for pushing a Ukrainian player as he ran toward the penalty area .
15 minutes each way for extra-time was not used effectively by the teams ; neither side attacked hard and in the second period there were no shots at all .
Switzerland almost got one but Andriy Gusin blocked Marco Streller 12 yards from goal .
Ukraine took and missed the first penalty but won the shootout 3-0 after Artem Milevskiy scored first with a impudent chip down the middle .
For the Swiss Barnetta hit the bar , and then Shovkovskyi made two saves low to his right and left to send Ukraine through to a quarter-final match against Italy .
Switzerland was eliminated from World Cup competition without having conceded a goal during the entire tournament -LRB- excluding penalty shootout goals -RRB- , the first time this has happened in World Cup history .
Match 54 Attendance : 45 ' 000 `` Notes are from the goalkeeper 's view . ''
`` Substitutes '' `` Substitutes '' Referee : Benito Archundia Italy win with last kick against Australia ; into quarter-finals

July 12 , 2006
Israel has launched an incursion into southern Lebanon in what they claim is a search for two Israeli soldiers .
The soldiers were taken Wednesday following an attack by Hezbollah , a Lebanese militia , that had made an incursion into Israel .
Three Israeli soldiers died and eleven were wounded when army transports patrolling at the Israeli-Lebanese border were attacked on Wednesday morning , near the Israeli village of Zar ` it .
Hezbollah also fired mortars and long-range rockets at the Israeli town of Shlomi and nearby communities .
Six Israeli civilians were injured by the artillery fire .
After the attack two soldiers were found to be missing .
Israeli troops and tanks then entered southern Lebanon , having claimed the soldiers were kidnapped -LSB- 1 -RSB- .
Following the incursion , five more soldiers were killed , four of them when an Israeli tank hit a mine .
Hezbollah said one of its members died .
The Israeli air-force targeted several roads , bridges and Hezbollah outposts in an attempt to stop militants from moving the soldiers , Israel said .
Two civilians were killed in an air raid on one of the bridges , while 23 others have been injured .
Israeli artillery and gunboats also attacked other targets on Lebanese soil .
Later , Hezbollah said they had destroyed an Israeli tank which had crossed the border into Lebanon .
Ehud Olmert , Israel 's Prime Minister , blamed the attack on the Lebanese government calling it `` an act of war '' and vowed to deliver a `` very painful and far-reaching '' response .
Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff Dan Halutz told Israel 's Channel 10 that if the soldiers are not returned `` we will turn Lebanon 's clock back 20 years '' .
Hezbollah Secretary-General , Sheik Hassan Nasrallah , hailed what he called the capture of the two soldiers calling them `` our natural , only and logical right '' .
He also said that the soldiers were taken to `` a far away place '' and that the only way to get them back was through an exchange with Lebanese and other Arab prisoners in Israeli jails .
The Israeli cabinet is in an emergency meeting and has yet to make an official statement about the situation .
PM Ehud Olmert said previously that swapping of prisoners is not an option .
Hezbollah 's announcement of their captures led to celebration scenes in a Hezbollah-strong suburb in Beirut with firing of guns in the air and handing out candy to children .
The Lebanese government issued a statement after an emergency meeting of the cabinet saying that it was not informed of the intentions of Hezbollah and that it does not endorse the group 's actions .
Prime Minister Fouad Siniora was quoted as saying that `` the government was not aware of and does not take responsibility for , nor endorses what happened on the international border '' .
Hezbollah currently has two sitting members on the Lebanese government 's ruling coalition .
The view recognized by the United States is one that condemned the attacks , but acknowledged that Lebanon had little say over Hezbollah in the south .
The White House said the militant group 's violent actions were supported by Iran and Syria .
Israel has filed a complaint with the United Nations which called for the Security Council to enforce resolutions urging Lebanon to extend its authority throughout its territory and to disarm its militias .

July 20 , 2006
Officials in Manila have issued evacuation orders for a 6 km -LRB- 4mi -RRB- radius around Mayon Volcano in the Philippines as ash clouds , rivulets of lava , and sulphur dioxide levels indicate an imminent explosive eruption .
Many residents , though , are hesitant to leave .
Regional disaster coordinating council official Angel Capilli has said that the people who farm the rich soil near the volcano would be `` forcibly '' removed from the area should vulcanologists determine an explosive eruption is imminent .
Mount Mayon has erupted 47 times in recorded history , with the last major eruption in 2001 shooting ash nearly 10 km above the volcano .

August 4 , 2006
A 16 year old girl has crashed her car into a hollow tree stirring up the fury of a swarm of bees ten miles -LRB- 16 km -RRB- south of Fort Wayne , Indiana .
Ten people including the girl received treatment at a hospital .
Jacqueline Cossairt 's SUV crashed into the tree after she lost control on a gravel road .
Despite hot summer temperatures , firefighters wore full safety gear including face mask and oxygen tanks as they tried to rescue her from the wreck .
The bees were doused with foam and water .
`` Those bees were mad , '' said Volunteer Fire Chief Kent Gilbert , who was stung at least 50 times while trying to pull her from the wreckage .
`` I 've never seen bees , especially honeybees , attack like that . ''
`` I 'm not too swelled up , '' Gilbert said .
`` As long as I 'm standing upright , I feel OK , but if I bend down I get a headache .
The back of my head is real tender where they stung me . ''
Jacqueline was taken to Lutheran Hospital with broken legs and multiple bee stings .
A neighbour , a paramedic and seven firefighters were also hospitalized due to heat and bee stings .
Stan Grove , a biology professor at Goshen College , said that bees were most active during summer as they try to keep their hives cool by flapping their wings .
`` They do n't like to be jostled , '' said Grove .

August 15 , 2006
Dell , the world 's largest manufactuer of home computers , is recalling 4.1 million lithium batteries used in laptop computers because of the risk of their bursting into flame .
There have been at least six incidents since December of laptops catching fire because of overheated batteries .
The Consumer Product Safety Commission in the United States says it is the largest recall of electronic products in its history .
Scott Wolfson , spokesperson for the CPSC , says the affected laptops should only be run off of a power cord and not the battery .
Dell says that the computers are safe to use if the batteries are removed entirely .
At risk are those Dell Latitude , Inspiron , XPS and Precision laptops shipped between April 2004 and July 2006 .
`` In rare cases , a short-circuit could cause the battery to overheat , causing a risk of smoke and or fire , '' said Dell spokesman Ira Williams .
`` It happens in rare cases but we opted to take this broad action immediately . ''
Customers with concerns can call a special toll free number , 1-866-342-0011 or go to http://www.dellbatteryprogram.com to determine if their batteries are subject to the recall .

August 22 , 2006
Lech Walesa , the founder of the Solidarity movement has quit the organisation .
The Solidarity trade union movement and political party was founded in 1980 to combat Poland 's Communist government .
`` I have given up my membership last year because Solidarity and I have gone separate ways , '' said Walesa who served as Poland 's first post-Communist president from 1990 to 1995 .
Walesa , 62 , is boycotting Solidarity 's 26th anniversary celebration this month as he does not want to appear with current President Lech Kaczynski and his twin brother , Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski with whose policies he disagrees .
`` His approach is to first destroy and then think about what to build , '' Walesa said of the president .
Last August , he said of the union `` This is no longer my union .
This is a different era , different people , different problems . ''
It was revealed today that Walesa has not formally been a member of Solidarity since the beginning of this year .
`` He has not been paying membership fees since the end of last year , '' a leading Solidarity member , Jerzy Borowczak , told the AFP news agency .
Walesa says he left Solidarity after the union ignored his criticism of its support of the Law and Justice Party led by the Kaczynskis .
`` When my arguments were not reaching them , I gave instructions to terminate my membership , '' Walesa said .
`` It is not over the Kaczynskis , but that was the last straw . ''
Solidarity was created as an independent trade union when such organizations were outlawed under the Communist state .
Despite attempts to destroy the group through repressions , it came to embody a broad social anti-communist movement within Poland .
It is credited as one of many dissident movements which in the 1980s pressured reforms which eventually led to the dissolution of the Soviet Union and states in its sphere of influence .
Solidarity eventually came to power in Poland with Walesa serving as President of Poland from 1990 to 1995 .

filename:<doc id="48669" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=48669" title="Iran voices defiance towards nuclear deadline"><paragraph:1_7_8_10_12>:SNT_LIST
August 29 , 2006
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran expressed his unwillingness to conform to UN Security Council demands on Tuesday .
Ahmadinejad said , `` Peaceful nuclear energy is the right of the Iranian nation .
The Iranian nation has chosen that based upon international regulations , it wants to use it and no one can stop it . ''
Iran has until Thursday to comply with a U.N. Security Council demand to stop its uranium enrichment program .
If Iran does not comply by Thursday , the UN has left open the possibility of economic sanctions .
Ahmadinejad says that he is willing to listen to negotiations related to changing Iran 's nuclear program but that , '' ... any kind of dialogue should be based upon the certain rights of the Iranian nation . ''
While the rights of which Ahmadinejad speaks are not currently available for public viewing , Iranian academics point to the six issues in Iran 's standard diplomatic policy .
Iran has consistently claimed that it is enriching uranium and building plutonium-producing reactors for solely peaceful purposes -- for the generation of electricity , the exporting of materials for other civilian nuclear industries , and the creation of medical radioisotopes -- while many western nations have accused the country of running a clandestine nuclear weapons program .
They have cited as evidence for this Iran 's continual investment in dual-use technology which could be used for either civilian or military purposes , as well as alleging that Iran has not been forthright in disclosures of its nuclear developments .
Iran provoked international controversy in April 2006 when it announced an earlier nuclear success : the enrichment of a small amount of uranium to reactor-grade levels -LRB- 3.5 % of the isotope uranium-235 using gas centrifuge technology .
Concern was raised by some that if Iran was able to scale up its enrichment facilities to thousands of centrifuges , they could be used to produce bomb-grade uranium -LRB- 90 % uranium-235 -RRB- .
Iran has insisted that under the terms of the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , of which it is a signatory , it is guaranteed the right to develop nuclear energy for peaceful purposes .
None of Iran 's facilities currently have the ability to produce weapons-grade nuclear material , and most experts say it would be at least a decade for Iran to be able to build a functional nuclear weapon .

August 29 , 2006
Mexico 's electoral court has unanimously rejected claims of massive fraud in the July 2nd presidential election and reported that the partial recount ordered at the end of last month has not changed the original result of a narrow victory for conservative candidate Felipe Calderon of the National Action Party -LRB- PAN -RRB- .
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador of the left-wing Democratic Revolution Party -LRB- PRD -RRB- , continues to insist that the election was rigged and has vowed to continue fighting the result .
Lopez Obrador has rejected the ruling and suggested forming a rival parallel government .
There is no legal avenue to appeal the court 's ruling , in except of the 39th article of the Mexican Constitution which states : `` The sovereignty of the state resides on the citizens .
The citizens have always the righ to change or to modify its government '' , article that has been claimed by Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador as a right to summon a National Democratic Convention .
The seven judges have until August 31 to resolve all complaints and until September 6 to officially declare a president-elect or annul the elections .
Lopez Obrador has led massive protests in Mexico City over the past month demanding a full recount .
`` Never more will we accept that an illegal and illegitimate government is installed in our country , '' he told thousands of supporters following the ruling calling upon them to never accept Calderon as president and to decide if he should form a parallel government and -LRB- or -RRB- continue nationwide protests .
Leonel Castillo , the president of the tribunal , said Lopez Obrador 's claims of massive fraud `` turned out to be completely unfounded . ''
Lopez Obrador 's election team had filed complaints at 50,000 polling stations but the court ordered a recount at only 11,839 stations or 9 % of all voting locations following massive street protests .
Calderon won the intial ballot count by a margion of less than 0.6 %

filename:<doc id="49544" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=49544" title="Blair will quit as British PM within a year"><paragraph:1_7_8_9_12_13_14_15_16_18_19>:SNT_LIST
September 7 , 2006
British Prime Minister Tony Blair bowed to pressure from within his own Labour Party today by publicly confirming he will resign within a year .
`` I would have preferred to do this in my own way , '' said Blair who added `` the next party conference in the next couple of weeks will be my last party conference as party leader . ''
However , he refused to name the specific date of his resignation , `` The precise timetable has to be left to me and has to be done in the proper way , '' Blair insisted .
`` I 'm not going to set a precise date now .
I do n't think that 's right .
I will do that at a future date , and I will do that in the interests of the country . ''
He apologised for the party 's conduct this week saying it `` has not been our finest hour , to be frank '' .
Demands that Blair announce his resignation plans have mounted over the past few months particularly over concerns about the Prime Minister 's strong support for Israel during the Israel-Hezbollah war , the perception that he is a loyal follower of United States President George W. Bush and a precipitous slide in Labor 's support in public opinion polls where the party is now at a 16 year low .
Yesterday , eight Labour MPs resigned from their junior government positions over Blair 's refusal to announce his retirement .
They had previously been considered staunch Blairites .
The British press reports of a shouting match yesterday between Blair and his likeliest successor , Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown over the handover date .
`` I want to make it absolutely clear today that when I met the prime minister yesterday , I said to him , as I have said on many occasions to him and I repeat today , that it is for him to make the decision , '' Brown said .
`` I said also to him , and I make clear again today , that I will support him in the decisions he makes , that this can not and should not be about private arrangements but what is in the best interests of our party and , most of all , the best interests of our country . ''
Despite Blair 's announcement , several MPs expressed their dissatisfaction at his refusal to name a precise date and demanded that he leave sooner rather than later .
Manchester Blakeley MP Graham Stringer told the BBC if Blair `` thought it was going to take the politics out of the next nine months that simply is not going to happen '' .
MP Doug Henderson said `` It does n't seem to me that the public knows any more about the PM 's retirement plans .
People keep saying to me that the Labour party must have a clear direction forward with clear priorities and a new leader before the May 2007 -LRB- regional -RRB- elections . ''
The eight MPs who resigned as junior ministers or parliamentary secretaries , Wednesday , expressed a concern in their resignation letter that Blair needed to go soon in order not to harm the party 's prospects in next May 's elections to the Scottish parliament , Welsh assembly and English local authorities .
Blair became Prime Minister in 1997 when Labour defeated the Conservative government of John Major .
He has led the party to three majority victories and promised before the last election that his third term would be his last .

September 18 , 2006
Photographs published by the `` Investigate '' magazine and the newspaper `` Sunday Star Times '' has shown the Prime Minister of New Zealand Helen Clark 's husband , Peter Davis , being hugged and kissed by openly gay Auckland GP -LRB- General Practitioner -RRB- Dr. Ian Scott on election night 2005 .
The editor of `` Investigate '' , Ian Wishart , stated that at no time has `` Investigate '' ever suggested Davis is gay .
Wishart said that he has `` Been targeting Mr Davis for months and has appealed for readers to send him details of his private life .
-LSB- My -RSB- article makes no homosexual inferences and is merely an attempt to background Davis ahead of reports to follow . ''
`` Investigate '' has been publishing a series of stories involving Davis about an alleged incident overseas .
They were tipped off by New Zealand law enforcement .
`` The picture is all about trying to find out more about the alleged incident .
-LSB- I am -RSB- working through overseas sources to investigate the allegations .
Regardless of what his investigation uncovers , the results will be published . ''
Wishart also says there is more ` dirt ' to come .
Clark has called it a `` pack of lies '' and labelled it as a smear campaign .
`` I 've been aware of a smear campaign circulating for many months .
Actively circulated by National Party people .
And I 've had countless friends phone me about it .
It 's been assiduously spread through circles in business , the law , accountants -- it 's just come from all quarters . ''
Dr. Scott is a close friends of the couple and was , according to Clark , `` reasonably boisterous and drunk , '' when the situation occurred and Davis was `` a bit disgusted , '' when he was kissed .
`` We have a particularly small group of very close friends ... and Ian is right in there .
He is one of our oldest friends as a couple .
There is not a shred of truth to what Wishart says , '' said Clark .
`` People just fall about themselves laughing when they see that was the great ` gay ' allegation , '' Clark said .
Clark has partly blamed the Exclusive Brethren for the smear campaign as they were allegedly the ones who campaigned to unseat Labour and also allegations that they hired a private detective to follow Davis , the church has denied having any involvement .
Clark has said `` the smear campaign against her husband had spread far too wide for it to be the work of the Brethren alone , '' so she also blames Brash .
`` I think the National Party has stooped to new levels with his leadership .
I think we 're seeing the absolute desperation of , actually , the far Right in politics , which feels it has a right to rule , could n't cope with losing three elections in a row and there 's a desperation and nastiness about it and it will stoop to anything , '' Clark said .
Brash said that he rejects and condemns the rumour-mongering and a spokesman said : `` he -LSB- Brash -RSB- nor any of his MPs were involved in spreading them -LSB- rumours -RSB- .
National believes the private lives of politicians and their families should be just that -- private . ''
A source for the National Party said that people had phoned in with the rumour and National told them to `` go away . ''
Gerry Brownlee , Deputy leader of National , denies any National Party involvement .
He said : `` Despite Don Brash coming under fire for admitting his marriage was in difficulties amid speculation he had an affair , National is not in a vengeful mode and rejects any such suggestion .
The private lives of the families of MPs should be left out of the public eye . ''
Media experts are passing off `` Investigate '' 's story as poor journalism .
Including the head of New Zealand Broadcasting School , Paul Norris .
Norris said : `` The leader of a party has to expect their private life to impact on their leadership but in this case it seems Clark does not have a lot to answer to .
The story has very little substance . ''
Clark has denied that a meeting between Brash to discuss toning down personal attacks will take place .
But does say a meeting between party representatives could be arranged .
Clark has told the New Zealand Police that she believes that they have been followed by private detectives .
The police are yet to confirm that they are investigating the claim as of Monday morning .
Clark said that she has been `` told by a number of sources that private investigators have been hired to follow both herself and her husband , Professor Peter Davis . ''

September 26 , 2006
Additional Sessions Judge Ravinder Kaur confirmed today that Mohammed Afzal , a militant attached to the Pakistan-based outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed , would be executed on 20 October for his role in the attempted attack on the Indian Parliament building in 2002 .
On 13 December 2001 , at 11:45 a.m. local time -LRB- UTC +5:30 -RRB- , just as the MPs were preparing to leave the House , militants armed with AK-47s and hand-grenades breached the security at Gate No. 12 of the Parliament Building and opened indiscriminate fire , killing six policemen and one Parliament employee .
The Army , along with police and NSG `` Black Cats '' sealed the area and killed all five gunmen in a `` lock-down mop-up '' operation .
The attack increased tensions between India and Pakistan , which was accused by India of providing support to the Kashmiri militant group Jaish-e-Mohammed , involved in the attack .
A special court had earlier sentenced Delhi University lecturer S. Geelani , Afzal and Shaukat Hussain Guru to death under Section 3 -LRB- 2 -RRB- of POTA -LRB- indulging in terrorist acts leading to deaths -RRB- and Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code -LRB- murder -RRB- .
The court also fined Shaukat Hussain 's wife , Afsan Guru Rs. 10,000 and sentenced her to five years rigorous imprisonment for concealing details of the plot .
A Delhi High court ruling , however , later acquitted Afsana Guru and Geelani .
On 4 August 2005 , a Supreme Court bench including Justice P V Reddy and Justice P V Neolkar confirmed the death penalty for Mohammed Afzal and sentenced Shaukat Hussain Guru to 10 years rigorous imprisonment for concealing details of the conspiracy , thereby sparing him the gallows .
Although the Supreme Court upheld Geelani 's acquittal , it observed that his actions were not above suspicion and seemed to have supported the attack .

filename:<doc id="51196" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=51196" title="Sony plans global replacement of laptop batteries"><paragraph:1_2_5_10_13>:SNT_LIST
September 29 , 2006
After several laptop producers recalled a total of about 7 million products containing Sony batteries , the Sony Corporation said it will `` initiate a global replacement program ... in order to address concern related to recent over-heating incidents . ''
Sony previously admitted the recalls announced by Apple and Dell would cost up to 30 billion yen , which is a quarter of Sony 's profits in 2005 .
Several news sources expect this to reflect badly on the company , as it adds to problems with the PlayStation 3 and Blu-Ray DVD .
Since Dell announced recalls in August , Sony 's stock has lost almost 9 % of its value .
Keeping up with competitors like Apple and Dell , Toshiba and Lenovo have started recalling laptops with the lithium ion batteries .
Dell expanded its program to include about 4.2 million portables .
Following Sony 's statement , Fujitsu too declared it would replace the batteries involved .
A spokesperson for Toshiba added that the company does n't expect there to be any problems with personal computers , but it will replace their Sony batteries anyway , over customer concerns .
However , the company does n't expect to pick up the tab for it .
A Lenovo laptop with the problem battery caught fire in Los Angeles Airport earlier this month .
Consequently , Virgin Atlantic added them to a blacklist of prohibited laptops on their flights .
According to Sony , microscopic metal particles are to blame for overheating and potentially catching fire `` under certain rare conditions '' .
The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission advised ThinkPad users who want to continue using their portable to switch it off , remove the battery and continue with the AC adapter and power cord .

September 29 , 2006
The field of candidates running to lead the City of Toronto became larger today as former Liberal Party of Canada president Stephen LeDrew threw his hat in the contest for mayor of Canada 's largest city .
LeDrew is running against incumbent Mayor of Toronto David Miller , who is seeking a second term and city councillor Jane Pitfield , who was considered Miller 's main challenger until today .
With LeDrew entering the race there are a total of 38 candidates running for the position .
The election takes place on November 13 , 2006 .
Miller is a centre-left politician with links to the New Democratic Party though he also has support from some Liberals and Conservatives .
His opponents have been looking for a candidate to challenge him in light of what has been perceived as Jane Pitfield 's faltering candidacy .
LeDrew considered supporting Pitfield but , calling her `` Calamity Jane '' because of the mistakes she 's made in her campaign , concluded she could not unseat the mayor .
After other high-profile figures such as former Members of Parliament Dennis Mills and Sergio Marchi and former police chief Julian Fantino declined to enter the contest as a centre or centre-right candidate , LeDrew decided to enter the race .
Today was the last day to register as a candidate .
LeDrew has never run for public office though he has many years of experience as a `` back room '' operative in the Liberal Party and in municipal politics .
In 2005 , he declared bankruptcy and was ordered to pay 74 % of the $ 364,000 he owed in back taxes .
`` The evidence is that LeDrew consciously and continually neglected to pay income tax installments when due and appeared to regard his obligation to pay income tax as subordinate to all other personal obligations , '' wrote Justice John Ground of the Superior Court of Justice .
LeDrew says he was trying to pay off his tax debt but also had to pay personal expenses such as school fees for his children .
`` I 'd gone through a divorce .
I was in a law firm ... that broke up and I lost money in that .
I had four children to put into schools . ''
`` I was also working 2,000 hours a year -LRB- as a -RRB- volunteer as Liberal Party president .
I said , ` I owe taxes .
The taxpayer can wait .
My children can not . ' ''
`` I was proud of my choices , my priorities , '' he told the `` Toronto Star '' .
`` I 'd do it again .
Any father knows his children are the most important thing . ''

October 4 , 2006
2,887 ecstasy -LRB- Methylenedioxymethamphetamine -RRB- tablets were intercepted yesterday morning -LRB- NZDT -RRB- at the Auckland , New Zealand International Mail Center in a joint operation between New Zealand Customs officials and the New Zealand Police .
The tablets were being sent to a 32-year-old man living in Timaru from a man living in the United Kingdom .
The Timaru man is being charged with importing a class B drug , a controlled substance .
Altogether the tablets had a street value of an estimated NZ$ 173,000 .
The Timaru man has appeared in the Timaru District Court and will be in custody until Thursday .
Bill Perry , Manager for Drug Investigations at Customs , said : `` The parcel was posted from the United Kingdom to an address in Timaru .
This interception highlights New Zealand 's growing problem of illicit drug importation . ''
So far during 2006 Customs has intercepted a total of 6,026 ecstasy tablets , a decrease of 14,033 for the year of 2005 -LRB- 20,059 -RRB- .
`` However importations of ecstasy and other MDMA products are still an area of ongoing concern and monitoring for Customs , '' said Perry .
The International Mail Centre is the hub for all mail entering or leaving New Zealand .
Each month the mail center processes around three million incoming mail items and around two and a half million outgoing .
Simon Williamson , Manager for the Northern Ports Customs , said : `` Customs screens all mail entering the country using a range of methodologies including our officers ' skills and experience , x-ray equipment and detector dogs .
Volumes of mail are rising and Customs officers are gearing up for the busy Christmas season . ''
During 2006 crystal methamphetamine seizures by Customs have risen tenfold relative to the previous year .

October 6 , 2006
A small hole has been found on the Space Shuttle Atlantis on the right hand payload bay door radiator , NASA officials have stated and it is not known what exactly caused the hole .
`` The impact occurred sometime during the STS-115 mission last month .
The nature of the object that hit the shuttle radiator is n't known .
The hit , which left a hole about one-tenth of an inch in diameter , did n't endanger the spacecraft or the crew , nor did it affect mission operations , '' said NASA in a statement on their website .
`` Monsters and Critics.com '' reports that a small rock or meteroid may have hit the shuttle `` when returning from its mission '' and `` CBS News '' reports that `` space debris '' are to blame .
The hole did not cause any damage to any of the vital instruments or systems on Atlantis .

October 9 , 2006
The New Zealand A1GP team , with racer Jonny Reid , placed seventh in A1GP feature race and picked up four championship points in the second round at Brno track , Czech Republic .
New Zealand managed to secure themselves first place in the qualifying race by being fastest in all four qualifying segments with a time of 3:30.053 , Germany second with 3:30.524 .
This put New Zealand in the pole position to start the sprint race .
When racing for the 20 minute sprint race started Germany and New Zealand ` locked horns ' before the very first corner .
It ended with both cars crashing out of the race .
This crash made both New Zealand and Germany start from the end of the track for the feature race .
New Zealand managed to crawl their way back to get seventh place , but dropped to fourteenth place from twelfth , out of 23 competing nations , on the leader board with only five points .
David Sears , Engineering Team Director for both Germany and New Zealand , said : `` Reid and his German counterpart Nico Hülkenberg were warned about keeping apart ... but still ended up making life difficult for themselves . ''
Sears added : `` To finish first you must first finish and the track is incredibly wide here at Brno , so why New Zealand and Germany should be rubbing wheels on the very first corner is anyone 's guess .
To recover and finish strongly was encouraging for Jonny and the car certainly has the raw speed and looks to be one of the quickest going around .
That 's the pleasing part amid the disappointment and we now need to refocus and prepare for the next month 's round in China . ''
`` We were so much quicker than the other teams in qualifying that it would be criminal to be banging wheels when a great result is there for the taking . ''
The next A1GP race takes place on November 12 in Beijing .

October 12 , 2006
Canadian Liberal Leadership frontrunner Michael Ignatieff refused to attend a debate with all three frontrunners in Toronto , on Tuesday .
Instead , Bob Rae , second place to Ignatieff in Leadership race , Stéphane Dion , and Gerard Kennedy attended .
Ignatieff was invited to attend but refused to participate in the event .
His spokeswoman described it as `` arbitrarily restricted to perceived ` front-runners .
She said Mr. Ignatieff wanted all eight candidates to be present .
`` We were approached several months ago by the Canadian Club-Empire Club to participate in a debate that was only to include Stéphane Dion , Bob Rae and Michael , '' said the Ignatieff statement .
`` We advised the organizers that we are not prepared to participate in a debate that was arbitrarily restricted to the perceived ` frontrunners ' . ''
The leadership campaigns were notified several months ago the event was being planned , with advice sought on scheduling for after the `` Super Weekend . ''
Ignatieff also offered to speak alone , but it did not happen .
`` His camp would say participating in a debate where invitations are not extended to all the candidates would be doing a disservice and would be rude to the other -LRB- four -RRB- candidates , '' said Liberal strategist Scott Reid .
`` That 's smart because he wants to flatter people whose support he would require for a later ballot . ''
However , Reid said other camps would suggest that Ignatieff is avoiding a mix-up with the three contenders with the best chances of supplanting him at the November 28 to December 3rd convention in Montreal .
Ignatieff 's name was only mentioned once in the whole debate .
Mr. Rae , who spoke of Canada 's perennial national unity difficulties as requiring practical , constructive solutions rather than `` abstract , theoretical discussions to resolve the constitutional riddle , '' an allusion to Mr. Ignatieff 's proposal to reopen the Constitution debate and have the province of Quebec recognised as a nation within Canada .
`` Trying to build support , build momentum on later ballots that 's really where this campaign is being fought now , '' said `` CTV 's '' Roger Smith .
The party 's final formal debate in Toronto on October 15 is the big chance for Ignatieff to get more supporters .

October 26 , 2006
In an interview earlier today , the leader of the recent political coup in Thailand , General Sonthi Boonyaratglin , said that he could not find solid evidence to support corruption charges against ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra .
`` It will be difficult to implicate him , '' said General Boonyaratglin .
He added that he is `` not sure how far the Office of the Auditor General can investigate suspected corruption cases involving him .
They might get to nowhere at all ... We can not impound the money he made with accountable legal evidence , but can only look for some possible hidden -LRB- evidence -RRB- with questionable background ... '' General Sonthi also justified the bloodless coup of September 19 by saying that the rampant corruption in Thailand was undermining democracy there .
After the coup , General Sonthi quickly reinstated the country 's corruption watchdog to work alongside his own team of investigators to find evidence of corruption in Mr. Thaksin 's leadership .
In addition to corruption , General Sonthi also cited the Thaksin administration 's perceived lack of respect for the king as another reason to have staged the coup .
He said that `` Soldiers are obliged to protect the national security , safeguard the nation , and uphold loyalty to the monarchy .
The military can not tolerate any leaders who lack or have limited loyalty to the king ... '' Insulting the 78-year-old monarch , who has spent 60 years on the throne , is considered a very serious crime in Thailand .
The general has admitted that the military could lose public support if no evidence is found to support the accusations .
Mr. Shinawatra is currently living in exile in London .

filename:<doc id="53376" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=53376" title="Bush signs law to build fence at US-Mexico border"><paragraph:1_3_9_10_12_16_21_22>:SNT_LIST
October 27 , 2006
Today U.S. President George W. Bush signed into law the Secure Fence Act of 2006 , a plan to build a 700 mile -LRB- 1,125 kilometer -RRB- fence between the United States and Mexico , to prevent illegal immigration .
Mexico has expressed strong opposition to the fence , which covers about one third of the total border length .
`` Unfortunately , the United States has not been in complete control of its borders for decades and therefore illegal immigration has been on the rise , '' Bush was quoted saying .
`` Ours is a nation of immigrants .
We 're also a nation of law ... We have a responsibility to address these challenges .
We have a responsibility to enforce our laws .
We have a responsibility to secure our borders .
We take this responsibility seriously , '' the President explained .
Congress passed the bill last month with a convincing majority , but the signing has been delayed until now , 12 days before the mid-term elections in the U.S. Yesterday the president already envisioned funding and manpower increases for border control , and extra beds to counter the `` catch-and-release at our southern border '' .
Earlier this month , Bush arranged a $ 1.2 billion budget for the fence , along with cameras , sensors , satellites and other security measures , to create a `` 21st-century '' border -- but the fence alone is roughly estimated to cost twice that amount .
A U.S. poll this week showed that there are more Americans in favor of an increased number of Border Patrol agents , while less then half of those questioned agreed with the fence .
According to the BBC , about 10 million Mexicans live in the U.S. , and about four million of them are estimated to be illegal .
Though , since illegal immigrants are not registered in any official sense , this number may be much higher , and other figures have circulated in the press .
Bush has declared he will attempt to counter `` widespread document fraud '' , and opposes the idea of granting illegals who work in the U.S. quick citizenship , or amnesty .
According to Bush , `` There is a rational middle ground between granting an automatic path to citizenship for every illegal immigrant and a program of mass deportation , and I look forward to working with Congress to find that middle ground . ''
Since Bush took office , he said , about 6 million have been intercepted and deported .
Mexico previously said it deplored the idea , and considers taking this to the United Nations .
The Organization of American States also expressed `` deep concerns '' over the fence , calling the proposal `` a unilateral measure that goes against the spirit of understanding that should characterize how shared problems between neighboring countries are handled and that affects cooperation in the hemisphere . ''
The outgoing Mexican President Vincente Fox has compared the fence with the Berlin Wall , while President-elect Felipe Calderon thought it was a `` grave mistake '' , and also that `` the fence doesn \ ' t resolve anything '' , causing more casualties along the border .
Other politicians in Mexico accused the U.S. of hypocrisy , benefiting from cheap Mexican workers but not allowing them to acquire citizenship .
Border Patrol agents watch for illegal entry from Mexico into the U.S. T.J. Bonner , who heads the National Border Patrol Council , told AP that `` A fence will slow people down by a minute or two , but if you do n't have the agents to stop them it does no good .
We 're not talking about some impenetrable barrier . ''
The immigration issue has divided the U.S. Republican party recently , and has brought many demonstrators to the street .
The plan could have been balanced with measures to legalize some immigrants already in the U.S. , and a foreign worker program , but Bush could n't convince many of his Republican Party colleagues .

November 6 , 2006
Michael Ignatieff wants to reopen the Constitution to have a debate about Quebec as a nation within Canada .
It is to be debated at the convention two days before the new leader is chosen .
Bob Rae , current Liberal leadership candidate , warned about reopening the Constitution .
According to Ignatieff 's website it says that Rae `` supported the notion that Quebec is a nation , '' and `` we can be both a Quebecker and a Canadian . ''
`` I 'm not somebody who is going to set this country on a constitutional adventure , whose consequences and whose outcome I 'm not certain of , '' Rae said .
`` For me , what 's important is to stay open to Quebec , but we will not reopen the Constitution , '' he said yesterday at an Ottawa book signing for his new book , `` Canada In The Balance '' .
The other seven leadership contenders have expressed their feelings on this issue saying that they have some discomfort with it .
Former Liberal PM Jean Chrétien , repeatedly said in the past that Canada was working well and most people did not care about changing the Constitution .
`` They say that when you have a nation , there must be a corresponding state to this nation .
That is the equation they make , '' said Intergovernmental Affairs Minister Benoît Pelletier .
`` They have the impression that each state must correspond to a single nation .
That is false .
States can be made up of a plurality of nations .
The sovereigntists make the same mistake . ''
`` You should not raise expectations that can not be met and we should not be engaging in an abstract debate in this country at this point in time .
We should be focusing our attention on issues that really matter to people , '' says Rae .
Ignatieff will outline his ideas for Quebec being a nation within Canada at the convention two days before the new leader will be picked in Montreal , December 3 .

November 29 , 2006
A number of properties in a Hare Krishna village in Kazakhstan were demolished on November 21 , by the local authorities , causing international outrage by religious freedom groups and Hindu associations alike .
Since the attack fears are now rising within the community of further demolition to the remaining properties , including the main temple structure .
`` The community is in shock , but they are determined to defend their homes and place of worship , '' community member Govinda Swami told Forum 18 News Service .
He says destruction of the temple would be `` devastating '' .
The authorities in Kazaksthan claim that the Hare Krishna devotees had no official right to their homes .
However human rights activists Ninel Fokina and Andrei Grishin , state in reply that while 13 out of the 66 Hare Krishna homes were destroyed on court orders , `` the adjacent houses of other people who do not belong to the Society for Krishna Consciousness were left untouched even though their title deeds have the same status '' .
The Hare village itself , known as ` Sri Vrindavan Dham commune ' -LRB- named after Vrindavan forest in India is based in the Keskelen district , in the town of Seleksia , close to Almaty .
It was the only village of it 's type run by Hare Krishna devotees in the country .
According to human rights activist Yevgeni Zhovtis : `` Unfortunately Kazakh law does not prohibit evictions during the winter period and also does not oblige the court bailiffs to give those being evicted a few days notice , '' `` All the same , there were crude violations of the law .
The court bailiffs had the right to evict the residents of the houses but not to demolish the buildings themselves .
It was also a very crude violation to throw the belongings of the Krishna devotees into the mud .
The court bailiffs were obliged to put the devotees ' belongings into store . ''
Local journalist Grishin claims to have had his camera confiscated by the Police and to have been threatened `` If I see you here again , I will personally smash your eyes , even though I am the hakim . ''
Protests are being made by Hindu groups and members of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness around the world in an attempt to halt any further demolition or other forms of alleged religious persecution .
Groups within the UK have brought the issue to the attention of both Tony Blair , and the House of Commons .
One of the Indian political parties , Bharatiya Janata Party criticised the central government for keeping silence over the issue .
The party is expected to follow the saffron brotherhood agenda in the second term of Rajnath Singh .

December 3 , 2006
The chief of the Fijian military , Commodore Frank Bainimarama , has claimed that he is now in control of Fiji without having to stage a military coup .
Commodore Bainimarama said : `` Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase was no longer in control of the Government and unless he gives in to my demands he will have nowhere to live in Fiji . ''
There are predictions that the military will send out armed troops into the streets of Fiji 's capital , Suva in the afternoon -LRB- 0300 GMT -RRB- .
Commodore Bainimarama said : `` I assure him -LSB- Mr Qarase -RSB- that he will not be kidnapped or put under any form of house arrest .
It will be a peaceful transition . ''
According to the Fijian newspaper `` Sunday Post '' , sources inside the government and the military have confirmed that there will be a government takeover tomorrow .
Commodore Bainimarama will set up a interim administration .
Prime Minister Qarase , said that Commodore Bainimarama is `` deranged and unstable . ''
However Commodore Bainimarama responded to this , he said that they were `` the action and words of a cornered rat . ''
The government and his cabinet are in hiding outside of Suva , Fiji , but the Prime Minister assures everyone that he is still in control of the government .
Referring to the hiding , Commodore Bainimarama said : `` Qarase had better come out of hiding because right now I 'm in control of him . ''
`` We want freedom to live within a democratically civil government , where the government is elected by the people .
We do not want a dictator , '' Mr Qarase said in a nationally broadcast interview .
Mr Qarase said the he expects that he will be the Prime Minister for another four and a half years as he believes that the Fijian people do have confidence in him .

filename:<doc id="55907" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=55907" title="Philippine typhoon toll may hit 1,000"><paragraph:1_3_4_6_8_10_11_13_15_16>:SNT_LIST
December 3 , 2006
Philippine president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo declared a state of national calamity Sunday in the wake of Typhoon Durian , allowing the government to more rapidly release funds needed to bolster search and rescue efforts .
Relief efforts in the Philippines faced delays Sunday for survivors , as fears grew of a rising death toll in the archipelago nation from last week 's storm .
Red Cross officials recorded a death toll of at least 406 , with 398 others missing and another 489 as injured , based on figures provided by mayors of devastated towns in the eastern Philippines , where Durian hit with 139 mph winds and torrential rains on Thursday .
Canada pledged $ 870,000 and the Netherlands Red Cross pledged $ 53,000 to help the country deal with the aftermath of the storm that triggered massive flooding and volcanic mudslides .
The United States also promised an undetermined amount of aid .
Many provinces lost power , making communication virtually impossible .
In one of the worst hit provinces , Albay , two villages were buried by volcanic mudslides and volunteers were working to recover bodies from the wreckage .
According to the Red Cross , rescue boats were used to survey the damage and take people to the 305 evacuation centers .
The Red Cross estimated about 66,616 people were now homeless based upon the number of homes destroyed in the wake of Durian .
Earlier , the National Disaster Coordinating Council said 38,473 displaced people were in evacuation shelters .
The Philippines ' location in the northwestern Pacific puts it right in the pathway of the world 's top typhoon generator , according to meteorologists .
Durian is the fourth devastating typhoon to strike the Philippines in the past four months , covering the Mayon volcano with so much wind and rain that ash and boulders cascaded down its slopes in walls of black mud that swamped entire villages Thursday .
Hemmed in by geography and poverty , the Philippines has tried to minimize the damage caused by the 20 or so typhoons that hit the sprawling archipelago every year .
Nationwide in 2001 - 05 , 2,892 people were killed and 909 others went missing in typhoons and other storms , which caused damage totaling US$ 521 million , says the National Disaster Coordinating Council .
Anthony Golez , the council 's deputy chief , notes that the estimate does n't include losses to employment and other economic opportunities , and that Filipinos should be `` bombarded '' with disaster information , including stories of the Indian Ocean tsunami two years ago and the February 2006 landslide in the central Philippine village of Guinsaugon that killed more than 1,000 .
Senator Richard Gordon , who heads the Philippine National Red Cross , said better planning is needed .
`` The big problem here in our country is we do n't plan our communities .
It 's every man for himself . ''

December 6 , 2006
The Iraq Study Group presented its report at 12.00 GMT today .
It warns `` No one can guarantee that any course of action in Iraq at this point will stop sectarian warfare , growing violence , or a slide toward chaos '' .
The Report opens with plea for open debate and the formation of a consensus in the United States about the policy towards the Middle East .
The Report is highly critical of almost every aspect of the present policy of the Executive towards Iraq and it urges an immediate change of direction .
First among its 78 recommendations is that a new diplomatic initiative should be taken before the end of this year to secure Iraq 's borders against hostile interventions and to re-establish diplomatic relations with its neighbors .
The Group points out that it is in the interest of its neighbors , that there should be stability in Iraq .
To this end , it proposes the formation of an Iraq International Support Group to include not only those countries , but also key states in the region , the member states of the UN Security Council and other countries such as Germany , Japan and South Korea .
The US contribution should be led at least by the Secretary of State or even the President himself .
Urgent attention should be directed to establishing Arab-Israeli peace on all fronts .
The Study Group recognizes that the establishment of permanent US military bases in Iraq would be a major impediment to establishing stability in the country .
The role of the armed forces should be redefined and between 10,000 and 20,000 troops -LRB- compared with 3,000 to 4,000 now -RRB- should be deployed to the task of developing the combat capability of Iraq armed forces .
The aim should be to withdraw all US combat forces early in 2008 .
The Report is critical of the US intelligence services and urges that more resources should be devoted to training those about to serve in the theatre in the language and culture of the region .
It asserted that government is still largely ignorant of the insurgency in Iraq or of the role of the militias .
The Group considered , but rejected , options involving the partitioning of Iraq and asserted the importance of creating and maintaining a democratically elected government of Iraq as an independent sovereign state .

December 7 , 2006
The New Zealand Government has tabled the Therapeutic Products and Medicines Bill , despite unprecedented political opposition .
In 2003 the Hon Annette King signed a Treaty with Australia agreeing to hand control of the natural health products sector over to an Australian regulatory body , however she needs to pass enabling legislation in New Zealand .
`` This will be a world-class joint scheme designed to regulate the safety , quality , effectiveness and promotion of therapeutic products in both New Zealand and Australia .
That includes the regulation of complementary and alternative medicines , over-the-counter and prescription medicines , medical devices , blood and blood products and tissues and cellular therapies , '' Ms King said .
Twice the Bill has been thrown out by select committees , but the Government is determined to ram it through Parliament , according to the New Zealand Health Trust .
`` Late tonight the Bill was finally tabled , with no announcement from the Minister , '' said Amy Adams , spokesperson for the Trust , `` Clearly the Minister is keen to sneak it into Parliament under cover of the silly season , in the hope that she can keep it under the public 's radar . ''
`` I welcome the support of a majority of the House who want to see the Bill go to Select Committee where New Zealanders can have their say , '' Ms King said .
The NZ Health Trust conducted research earlier this year which showed 62 % of New Zealanders used natural health products .
`` This Bill represents a massive and irreparable change to the way we make rules for New Zealand dietary supplements , '' Mrs Adams said .
`` Under the proposed regime , well over a million New Zealand consumers would find the choice of products adversely affected , and experience cost increases .
So you can see why the Government is trying to sneak this into the House without any fuss - they do n't want the public to know . ''
All the political parties except Labour have pledged their opposition the proposal , despite some intense lobbying by Australian and New Zealand officials .
`` It is a very serious thing to hand sovereignty over your country over to another nation , '' Mrs Adams said .
`` And all the other political parties see the sense in making sure the sector is regulated from New Zealand - not as a minor state of Australia . ''
Ms King said : `` The Bill ... ensures that New Zealand will have an equal say in the setting up and running of the new Authority and joint scheme . ''
The new authority will be like a crown-owned entity and will have to provide an anuual report and a statement of intent to parliament each year .

December 10 , 2006
Stargazers in Massachusetts will get a rare show on Sunday night , just before the local Sunrise .
The planets Mars , Mercury and Jupiter will line up and will be seen in clear skies at least 45 minutes before sunrise , and will be seen each morning until December 14 , 2006 .
`` Jupiter will be very bright and it will look like it has two bright lights next to it , and they wo n't twinkle because they 're planets .
When I look at something like this , I realize that all the powers on Earth , all the emperors , all the money , can not change it one iota .
We are observers , but the wonderful part of that is that we are the only species on this planet that can observe it and understand it , '' said television show host of `` Star Gazer , '' Jack Horkheimer .
He is also director of the Space Transit Planetarium in Miami , Florida .
This will be the closest planet-lineup to Earth until 2053 .
The previous closest viewing occurred in 1925 .

December 17 , 2006
Nobel Prize winner Professor Paul J. Crutzen has stated he has data to support his controversial claim that injecting sulfur into the atmosphere would negate the greenhouse effect .
The data is intended to quiet critics of the theory he first discussed in the scientific journal `` Climatic Change '' in August , 2006 .
The 1995 Nobel Prize winner in chemistry stated '' `` Our calculations using the best models available have shown that injecting 1 million tonnes of sulfur a year would cool down the climate so the greenhouse effect is wiped out . '' ''
The theory uses the idea that an added layer of sulfates in the stratosphere , approximately 16 kilometres above the earth , would reflect sunlight back into space and reduce the amount of solar radiation reaching the Earth 's surface .
Critics have shown that the earth has struggled for decades to reduce sulfur pollution , and how it is a component of acid rain that kills plantlife and animals .
A large-scale experiment would be impossible to conduct , however scientists have noticed that massive volcanic eruptions have had similar effects on the earth .
The 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines lowered temperatures around the world for two years , according to data taken at the time .
Crutzen resparked discussion on the topic , a theory which has been dismissed up until now as dangerous . ''
`` Until August this was a taboo issue .
But the paper I published really set off some movement in this area .
It never hit the level of seriousness which it has taken in the past months , '' '' Crutzen said .
Environmental groups are skeptical but agree the idea should be investigated . ''
`` This idea should be examined and as a last resort it can buy us a few decades , '' '' said Steve Sawyer , a policy adviser for Greenpeace International .

December 29 , 2006
Australian A-League club Sydney FC has been docked three competition points by Football Federation Australia -LRB- FFA -RRB- after it was found guilty of breaching the Player Contracting Regulations .
The FFA stated that the offences warranted a A$ 259,000 fine as well as a three-point deduction , however it considered '' `` the cooperation and full disclosure provided by the current Sydney FC Board and Management to the FFA '' '' during the investigation process , and reduced the penalty to a A$ 129,000 fine plus two competition points deducted .
However , this most recent breach also activated a one-point suspended penalty issued to Sydney FC in August 2006 for previous breaches of the salary cap , increasing the total points lost during this case to three .
This latest breach also incurred a suspended penalty of a one - point deduction which will automatically be activated for any breaches during seasons 2006 - 07 or 2007 - 08 .
In a statement released on the official A-League website , '' `` the -LSB- FFA -RSB- Board determined that the following breaches had occurred : an undisclosed payment made to a player ; pre-payments from the Club to players ; and payments made by the Club to agents of the players '' '' .
Sydney FC , the defending champions of the A-League , will not be deducted the competition points immediately and has one week to appeal .
If Sydney decides not to appeal the FFA decision , the points will be removed on January 5 , 2007 .
According to Sportal , the club has notified the FFA it intends to appeal the decision , however no formal confirmation has been published .
Sydney FC have said in a statement on their website that '' `` the club will consider its options regarding the decision before issuing a further statement '' '' .
Sydney is currently sitting in second position on the 2006 - 07 A - League table and the three - point reduction would see it fall to third place .

January 3 , 2007
The city of Baqubah , just northeast of Baghdad , seems to have collapsed under insurgent control .
Government offices and schools are closed .
Assassinations take life and power from mayors , tribal chiefs and policemen .
Residents fear to leave their homes .
The majority Sunni-Muslim city was once full of promise for Americans .
Six months ago , Abu Musab al-Zarqawi , the leader of Al Qaeda in Iraq , was killed near here .
In October , U.S. forces in the area began to pull back , handing security largely over to Iraqi forces .
Now , `` The Los Angeles Times '' reports the capital city of the Diyala province has become one of Iraq 's most-troubled areas .
The Iraqi security forces in the area are abusive and neglectful , according to U.S. and Iraqi officials .
And insurgents have been seen on video pulling Shiite families from their homes , killing them , U.S. officials said .
A farmer in the area , Saad Adnan , told a reporter with the Institute for War and Peace Reporting last month : `` Baqubah is a symbol of resistance and Americans will be kicked out by the honorable mujahedin ... We are with the mujahedin .
They are heroes and history will remember Baqubah 's fight against the occupation . ''
A masked , armed militant told the same reporter : `` Thank God , we are forging ahead with our goals .
We fight the occupation and kill every Iraqi policeman or soldier that protects the Americans .
If it was not for them , the Americans would have been terminated and kicked out . ''
U.S. military commanders have decided to step up their counterinsurgency efforts in the city .
They will add more troops and work toward reconstruction .
Late last month , combined American and Iraqi forces raided what the U.S. Army called `` a suspected terrorist training camp . ''
The Army said it captured 13 suspected insurgents during the raid .
Already , the U.S. has spent more than $ 220 million in the Diyala province .
But the road ahead appears long ; Iraqi contractors are refusing to enter the area and much-needed food and petroleum shipments have dropped off considerably .

January 28 , 2007
David Cameron , leader of the U.K. Conservative Party , has outlined his vision for the future of a multicultural Britain in an article published in the Observer on January 28 , 2007 .
In a sharp criticism of the efforts launched by the Labour government to promote national identity - which include among other things a Britishness test for those wanting to become UK citizens - he advocates `` a common culture defined by pluralism and tolerance and a distinctively British approach -LRB- calm , thoughtful , reasonable -RRB- to potentially incendiary issues . ''
Cameron agrees that there is a substantial alienation and division in the UK today and that `` many thousands , maybe millions , feel shut out , under attack . ''
However , he underlines that the way forward is not bullying people into Britishness but inspiring them to feel British .
According to him , this can only be achieved by offering equal opportunities and a quality education to everybody without denying anyone the chance to escape poverty and to fulfill their dreams .

January 28 , 2007
`` L'Alliance pour la Planète '' , a collective of French environmental organizations -LRB- such as WWF France -RRB- , has launched a campaign to promote awareness on climate change .
Under the theme `` Turn everything off ! ''
, they 're asking people to turn off their electricity for five minutes on February 1st , between 7:55 pm and 8:00 pm CET .
With the initiative , they hope to remind others , the media and politicians -LRB- such as the candidates for the upcoming French Presidential elections -RRB- of the ongoing waste of energy .
Everyone should turn off the light , as well as all electrical appliances - maybe a good moment for a candlelight dinner , they suggest .
The `` five minutes of silence '' are believed to put pressure on world governments to discuss the topic more seriously on an international scale .
Since the first call various similar international groups have stated their support and currently promote the idea on their websites and newsletters .
The date was originally chosen to match the release of the United Nations fourth climate change report , in which 2,500 scientists from more than 130 countries present their latest findings .
The report however has been delayed and will now be released on February 2nd .
In Belgium , non-profit organizations such as Oxfam support the action .
The consortium is working with the power distribution company to prevent any negative impact a sudden drop of energy demand might have on the electricity network .

February 3 , 2007
According to news reports from Turkey , a number of the members of the Turkish security forces , though unofficially , are treating Ogün Samast , the assassin of Hrant Dink as if he were a national hero .
For instance , after being taken into custody , Samast was filmed shoulder to shoulder with the Turkish police , in front of a Turkish flag and a quote from Turkey 's founder Atatürk : `` The nation 's land is sacred .
It can not be left to fate . ''
On January 24th , Ogün Samast was transferred to the Bayrampaşa prison , Istanbul 's largest prison .
Before the transfer , inmates from a section of the prison were temporarily moved to another section , which , as a result , housed more than 100 inmates , 80 more than its maximum capacity .
Then , the now-vacant section , often subject to inmates ' complaints regarding bedbugs , was cleaned and disinfected .
Finally , the walls were painted , a brand new cotton bed was put in , and red carpet was laid out on the floors of the section .
When Samast was brought to the Bayrampaşa Prison , inmates witnessed that he was welcomed with cheers and applause by the jail management , soldiers , and the guards .
Witnesses also report that Samast was given two guards to serve him .
He ate kebab , a luxury food compared to the food given to other inmates .
After four days , Samast was transferred to the Kandıra F-type Prison .
Ultra-nationalist elements of the Turkish society seem to have penetrated into the Turkish security forces .
These events resulted major Turkish newspapers such as Sabah , Radikal , and Vatan to accuse the Turkish security forces and the Turkish state of supporting , endorsing , and cooperating with the killers of the journalist .
A 52 year old Turkish-Armenian journalist , Hrant Dink was assassinated in front of the Agos newspaper office , at the Istanbul district of Osmanbey , where he worked as the editor and a journalist .
Dink , a brave journalist who was not afraid to discuss one of Turkey 's most controversial issues , clearly called what happened to Armenians in 1915 when the land was being governed by the Ottoman Empire the Armenian Genocide .
Following her father 's assassination , Dink 's daughter , referring to the fascist obsession with pure blood , said : Large numbers of people marched protesting the killing of Hrant Dink on the day of his funeral , carrying placards that read `` We are all Armenian '' and `` We are all Hrant Dink '' .

February 9 , 2007
Violent clashes have broken out between Palestinians and Israeli police near the al-Aqsa Mosque and Temple Mount in Jerusalem , from controversy over Israeli construction near the site , which is holy to both Muslims and Jews .
The construction work reportedly is to repair a pedestrian bridge that leads to the Mugrabi Gate , the entrance to the mosque used by Palestinians , and runs over the Jewish Western Wall area of the complex .
The earthen ramp bridge leads to a hilltop compound known as the Temple Mount to Jews and as the Noble Sanctuary to Muslims .
The bridge collapsed in 2004 and was temporarily replaced with a wooden bridge which Israelis say is weakening and unsafe .
Israel has controlled the contentious compound since the 1967 Mideast War , The construction involves excavation work and digging at the site , which Palestinian leaders contend is part of an attempt to dig under the mosque to find evidence of the Jewish Second Temple and/or to deliberately weaken the foundation of the mosque .
Muslims dispute that the Temple was located at the site .
Some artifacts have been salvaged from the digging work .
Israeli forces locked down Palestinian neighborhoods of Jerusalem in anticipation of backlashes from the construction .
The Old Jerusalem city limits were blockaded , allowing only Palestinians over 45 years old from entering and only on foot .
Palestinians from the West Bank were completely barred .
Opponents have declared the blockades and the construction work a deliberate act to prevent Muslims from accessing the holy site .
The mass of protesters at the site have in turn blocked Jewish access to the Western Wall .
Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas declared the construction and blockade as `` hostile measures '' against Muslims .
Palestinian chief justice Tayssir al-Tamimi declared a `` day of anger '' and called on Palestinians to defend the mosque .
Arab and Muslim countries including Jordan , Malaysia and Indonesia criticized Israel for the controversial work and urged it to halt construction .
Israeli defense minister Amir Peretz also warned against starting construction .
The leader of the Pakistan Muslim League urged Muslim countries to freeze diplomatic ties with Israel in protest of the work .
Around 150 Muslims were inside the mosque for morning prayers when the construction and blockade began .
An Israeli Muslim journalist reported that the worshippers were unable to leave and received loud messages from Israeli loudspeakers .
The al-Aqsa mosque is the third holiest site in Islam , having once been the central point of prayer -LRB- qibla -RRB- for Muslims and allegedly the place where Muhammad ascended into heaven .
Conventional Judaism believes it is also the historic site of the First and Second Temples , the holiest temple in Judaism , which is prophesised to be rebuilt ahead of the coming of the Messiah .
No deaths have been reported in the clashes , which simmered by evening .
Demonstrations also took place at mosques throughout the Muslim world , including Egypt and Jordan .
Protests were expected later in the day in Nazareth .
The incident comes only a few days after rival Palestinian political factions , Hamas and Fatah , came to an agreement for a unity government aimed at restoring international support of Palestine and a return to Israeli negotiations .

March 1 , 2007
The partnership between New Zealand 's monopolistic ISP , Xtra and Microsoft New Zealand , XtraMSN has expired today and has been replaced with a partnership between Xtra and Yahoo! 7 , YahooXtra .
Yahoo! 7 is also a partnership , between Yahoo! and the 7 television station in Australia .
The partnership 's website was launched today , as well as a new MSN New Zealand homepage .
Yahoo!Xtra are trying to become the homepage of all New Zealanders with the claim the partnership will beef up content , as well as being the biggest website in New Zealand in terms of revenue .
Kevin Kenrick , Telecom 's consumer products chief operating officer , who own Xtra , said the aim of Yahoo!Xtra was to , `` Yahoo!Xtra aimed to bring the best available international content and technology into a New Zealand context . ''
`` We do think Yahoo!Xtra will become an extension of New Zealanders living rooms . ''
Chief executive of Yahoo! 7 , Ian Smith , said that two to three percent of all the advertising market was from online advertising .
In Australia , that number is around eight percent , which Mr Smith expects to become the number for New Zealand .
Mr. Smith said : `` Yahoo!Xtra will be the best of New Zealand linked to the best the rest of the world has to offer , and puts us in a prime position to capitalize on changing trends in media consumption and media usage . ''
Yahoo! 7 will own 51 % of the partnership , with Xtra owning the other 49 % .
Mr Smith will chair the board that will be created .
The partnership also means that current Xtra subscribers will receive a new e-mail messaging platform , but current e-mail addresses will remain the same .
This will mainly happen because of the mail technology currently offered by Yahoo! Other services owned by Yahoo! , such as Flickr and Answers , will also be brought into the new portal .
Mr. Kenrick and Mr. Smith both denied to disclose how much money from either sides has been invested , but do say that it will be profitable in the near future .
Other ventures between Yahoo! and telecommunication ISP 's have occurred internationally as well .

March 21 , 2007
In a Public Safety Bulletin released March 20 , 2007 , a coroner in Victoria , British Columbia , Canada , warns on the dangers of purchasing pills from online companies .
Rose Stanton , Regional Coroner for the Vancouver Island area , has linked the purchase of pills on the Internet to the recent death of a British Columbia woman .
The woman , a 57-year old from the Campbell River area , died from poisoning , according to preliminary test results .
The precise cause of death is still being investigated by police and the coroners service , according to Stanton .
In late December 2006 , the woman had told friends of feeling unwell with flu-like symptoms , and had experienced hair-loss and blurred vision .
She died a few days later .
Pills found in the possession of the dead woman were traced back to a purchase the woman made on a health-related website .
The death is thought to be the first in Canada caused by pills purchased on the Internet .
Analysis of the pills by the Provincial Toxicology Centre revealed that some contained an anti-anxiety drug , obtained normally with a prescription in Canada .
In addition , the pills contained a sedative not legally sold in Canada , which has been linked to overdose deaths in other countries .
On further testing , the pills were found to contain a non-medicinal filler and revealed the presence of heavy metals , some of which can cause serious illness , according to the Bulletin .
`` We can not impress upon the public strongly enough the dangers of buying medications online from a company you do n't know , '' said Stanton .
`` There is just no way of knowing what you are getting . ''
The website in question belonged to a group of companies which , according to the coroner 's investigation , change websites and Internet addresses every few days .
The B.C. Coroners Service is recommending that if someone has purchased drugs over the Internet that they are uncertain about , they should bring them , in the original packaging , to a pharmacy for proper disposal .

March 23 , 2007
In a press release earlier today , New York State Agriculture Commissioner Patrick Hooker , along with Dean of Cornell University 's College of Veterinary Medicine Donald F. Smith , confirmed that scientists at the New York State Food Laboratory identified Aminopterin as a toxin present in cat food samples from Menu Foods .
Menu Foods is the manufacturer of several brands of cat and dog food subject to a March 16 , 2007 recall .
Aminopterin is a drug used in chemotherapy for its immunosuppressive properties and , in some areas outside the US , as a rat poison .
Earlier reports stated that wheat gluten was a factor being investigated , and officials now state that the toxin would have come from Chinese wheat used in the pet food , where it is used for pest control .
Investigators will not say that this is the only contaminant found in the recalled food , but knowing the identity of the toxin should assist veterinarians treating affected animals .
The Food Laboratory tested samples of cat food received from a toxicologist at the New York State Animal Health Diagnostic Center at Cornell University .
The samples were found to contain the rodenticide at levels of at least 40 parts per million .
Commissioner Hooker stated , '' `` We are pleased that the expertise of our New York State Food Laboratory was able to contribute to identifying the agent that caused numerous illnesses and deaths in dogs and cats across the nation . ''
The press release suggests Aminopterin , a derivative of folic acid , can cause cancer and birth defects in humans and can cause kidney damage in dogs and cats .
Aminopterin is not permitted for use in the United States .
The New York State Food Laboratory is part of the Federal Food Emergency Response Network -LRB- FERN -RRB- and as such , is capable of running a number of unique poison/toxin tests on food , including the test that identified Aminopterin .

April 11 , 2007
Canadian MP Belinda Stronach has officially announced she will not run for re-election in her riding of Newmarket -- Aurora in the next federal election .
She will re-join her father Frank Stronach 's company Magna International Inc. , a large auto parts company , as the executive vice-chairwoman .
`` My father is looking to the future , the company is facing important strategic decisions , and the Canadian and global auto sector and economy are in a period of great challenge , '' Stronach announced .
`` So I am stepping aside from elected politics for the time being and will now take part in public life in a different way ... I will continue to represent the interests of the constituents I serve until such time as a federal election is called , '' she said .
`` I also plan to continue to play an active role in the community . ''
During Stronach 's career a series of events have made national headlines .
In 2004 , she ran against now Prime Minister Stephen Harper for leadership of then the new formed Conservative Party of Canada and finished second on the first ballot .
She was later elected as Conservative MP for Newmarket -- Aurora .
Stronach had many differences to Stephen Harper and his Conservatives supporting abortion and same-sex marriages .
She also claimed the party was going too far-right .
In 2005 , two days before a non-confidence vote to bring down the Liberal government , she crossed the floor to the Liberal Party of Canada and retained her seat .
Upon her crossing she immediately became Minister of Human Resources and Social Development and Minister responsible for Democratic Renewal .
It also ended her personal relationship with fellow Conservative MP Peter MacKay .
If Stronach had not joined the Liberals an election would have been called .
On April 6 , 2006 , Stronach held a news conference announcing that she would not seek the leadership of the Liberals , which was later won by Stephane Dion .
In September , she was caught cheating with former NHL player Tie Domi .
In October 2006 , Peter MacKay referred to Stranach as a `` dog '' .
Stronach , a feminist , demanded an immediate apology and said that it offended all Canadian women .
CTV bureau chief Robert Fife speculated the decision by Stronach , not to seek re-election , may have had something to do with her dissatisfaction over a diminished role in the new Dion caucus .
`` She did not have a high-profile critic 's role and she had not been prominent in asking questions in question period after Mr. Dion took over , '' suggested Fife .
Stronach has been serving as Critic for Competitiveness and New Economy .
She previously served as Critic for the Minister of Transport under interim leader Bill Graham .
The public is also questioning Stronach 's move to keep her seat until the next federal election , they happen every five years or less .
If she had decided to leave her seat completely , an immediate by-election would be called .

The human rights organisation Amnesty International says that Iraq now ranks fourth in the list of countries with high execution rates .
Since mid 2004 , Iraq has sentenced 270 people to death , at least 100 of whom have already been hanged .
Amnesty says that Iraq 's reintroduction of the death sentence goes against a general global trend for its abolition .
In a press release , Amnesty says many of the trials are unfair , criticising the use of televised pre-trial confessions and a failure to investigate allegations of torture .
Kate Allen , Amnesty 's UK director said : `` The clock has been turned back in Iraq and we 've seen a return to large numbers of people being condemned to death and hastily executed after unfair trials , '' The criticisms have been dismissed by Iraqi officials .
Sources -- The Conservatives have expressed regret for participating in a Sikh Parade in Surrey , British Columbia because a display of Indian saints included Talwinder Tarmar , the terrorist that led the 1985 Air India bomb plot .
The president of the temple that organized the parade claims that he is not guilty .
Sources A bag of cocaine worth around $ 8,900 was found by a first grade boy while checking his jacket pocket .
The bag contained 89 grams of crack cocaine .
`` The boy got scared and told his teacher '' , said a Tampa police spokeswoman .

April 24 , 2007
A planet 50 % greater in radius and with about 5 times earth mass orbiting the red dwarf Gliese 581 has been discovered inside the constellation of Libra .
A 2005 search revealed that the star Gliese 581 possessed a Neptune sized planet , prompting astronomers to take a closer look .
Gliese 581 c , as the planet is aptly named , has an estimated surface temperature between 0 and 40 °C -LRB- 32 and 104 °F -RRB- .
Scientists claim the planet is likely to have an atmosphere and liquid water .
A second planet , about 8 times the mass of earth , was also discovered not too far from Gliese 581 c .
A team of scientists from France , Switzerland and Portugal discovered the planets using the ESO 3.6-m telescope from the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher or HARPS , located at the European Southern Observatory -LRB- ESO -RRB- in La Silla , Chile .
`` The separation between the planet and its star is just right for having liquid water at its surface , '' said team spokesperson Stephane Udry of the Observatory of Geneva in Versoix , Switzerland .
`` That 's why we are a bit excited . ''
`` Liquid water is critical to life as we know it and because of its temperature and relative proximity , this planet will most probably be a very important -LSB- focus -RSB- of future space missions dedicated to the search for extra-terrestrial life .
On the treasure map of the Universe , one would be tempted to mark this planet with an X , '' added Xavier Delfosse , from Grenoble University in France .
The newly discovered planet is 20.5 light-years away from the Earth .

May 8 , 2007
Federal investigators in the United States have arrested six men on Monday evening on charges of conspiracy to kill US servicemembers .
The men are alleged to be members of an Islamic radical terror cell who were planning a heavily armed attack against soldiers at the United States Army facility at Fort Dix in New Jersey .
The US Attorney 's Office said that some of the men were living illegally in the US , while others were legal immigrants .
It identified the men as Dritan Duka , Eljvir Duka , Shain Duka , Serdar Tatar , Mohamad Shnewer and Agron Abdullahu .
They were said to be four ethnic Albanians -LRB- from the former Yugoslavia -RRB- , one from Turkey , and the sixth man from Jordan .
Reportedly , the FBI had the men under surveillance for 16 months as they trained with both paintball guns and real weapons in the Poconos Mountains area of Pennsylvania .
The men video-taped their training and brought the tapes to a camera store to be copied to DVD .
The camera store owner alerted the FBI , which then began its investigation .
`` The Star-Ledger '' reports that the men were lured by an FBI informant into a sting operation to meet with an arms dealer where they wanted to purchase five AK-47 automatic machine guns and three M-16 assault rifles at a residence in Cherry Hill , New Jersey .
It was at this point they were arrested .
U.S. Attorney for New Jersey Christopher J. Christie called the camera store owner who tipped off the FBI to the terror cell `` an American hero '' , according to Richard Degener of `` The Press of Atlantic City '' .
Christie spoke at the Flanders Hotel on Tuesday to the Ocean City Regional Chamber of Commerce .
`` The camera store owner saw Muslim men in military garb toting weapons in the woods .
He heard them talking about jihad and how Allah was great .
He called the FBI and became a hero , '' Christie said .
One member of the terror cell was able to gain detailed knowledge of the military base from his work as a pizza delivery driver .
The plot was to take over guard posts and `` kill hundreds of Fort Dix soldiers '' , Christie said .
U.S. Marshal James Plousis joined Christie at the Chamber of Commerce luncheon with 50 area Atlantic City merchants to talk about the value of reporting suspicious activity .
`` They are not being charged with being members of an international terror organisation , '' said White House spokesperson , Tony Snow .
`` However , their involvement in weapons training , operational surveillance and discussions about killing American military personnel warranted a strong law enforcement response . ''

July 3 , 2007
Hamas has begun to use force to release captured BBC news reporter Alan Johnston .
Hamas also plans to release ten of its soldiers who were captured on Monday .
Johnston was kidnapped in Gaza City on March 12 , and has since been kept in captivity by a group calling itself `` The Army of Islam '' .
Despite mounting diplomatic pressure from Hamas and the British Government , Johnston has not yet been released .
The actions by Hamas come after reports that The Army of Islam planned to capture more journalists in order to strengthen their position , bargaining for the release of Iraqi Sajeda Rishawi , imprisoned in Jordan .
Hamas ' armed division is reported to have surrounded the neighbourhood of Sabra in Gaza , taking control of the suburb .
The Army of Islam has threatened to kill Johnston should any rescue attempt be made using force .
One civilian fatality has been reported as a result of the fighting between Hamas militants and The Army of Islam .
However , a spokesperson for Hamas said , `` This operation is not aimed at freeing Johnston , '' suggesting the primary objective is freeing its own men .

July 10 , 2007
Al-Qaeda 's No. 2 Ayman al-Zawahiri warned in a 20-minute audiotaped message that the knighthood of Salman Rushdie was defying the Islamic world by granting the honour to the author of `` The Satanic Verses '' , which was deemed an insult to Islam .
Al-Zawahri said in the message that a `` very precise response '' is in preparation to retaliate against this offence , `` And if you did not understand , listen , we are ready to repeat it for you . ''
Rushdie was given the knighthood last month by Queen Elizabeth II .
The United Kingdom 's Foreign and Commonwealth Office said the honor was not intended as an insult to Islam but was `` a reflection of his contribution to literature . ''

July 11 , 2007
Today , at 12:00 p.m. EDT -LRB- UTC-4 -RRB- the Animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals -LRB- PETA -RRB- staged a `` naked '' protest in White Plains , New York .
The target of the protest was British fashion house , Burberry , and their fur practices .
Two `` naked '' female PETA members , wearing nothing but bikini bottoms and body paint held billboards with the slogan , `` When plaid goes bad . ''
The body paint was done in the trademarked Burberry Check plaid design .
Two other PETA members were there handing out leaflets and showing a video presentation .
The painted protesters were spattered with far less fake blood than other documented PETA protests in this campaign .
PETA is protesting Burberry for the company 's use of fur in its products and how it is obtained .
The group has staged similar protests around the world in its ongoing `` BloodyBurberry '' - campaign .
The protest took place at the intersection of Westchester Avenue and Bloomingdale Road in front of the The Westchester , an upscale shopping mall owned by Simon Property Group .
Burberry has a retail store in the mall .
This corner is far from the mall 's entrances and sees little pedestrian traffic .
However , it does see heavy traffic by motorists , before whom the protestors were in plain sight .
While Wikinews was on the scene , police and news media were the only other pedestrians .
The police presence was significant , numbering at least two vehicles and two mounted police officers .
But since there was no crowd to control , they just hung back .
Media was also there in numbers .
At least two television crews could be observed .
As far as `` Wikinews '' can tell , Burberry has yet to make any public comment about any of the `` BloodyBurberry '' protests .

filename:<doc id="74669" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=74669" title="Explosion, steam eruption near Grand Central Terminal in New York City"><paragraph:1_5_9_12_14_17_18_21_24>:SNT_LIST
July 18 , 2007
A pipe has burst in New York City , the largest city in the United States , causing a generator to explode .
The explosion occurred in Midtown Manhattan near Grand Central Terminal -LRB- GCT -RRB- and the Chrysler Building , and approximately at the intersection of 41st Street and Lexington Avenue .
Nearby buildings have been evacuated , and a large area has been blocked off .
There are reports of a very large crater at the scene .
The New York Police Department -LRB- NYPD -RRB- has officially ruled out terrorism .
Grand Central Station was quickly evacuated soon after the incident .
Subway lines 4 , 5 and 6 have no service in both directions between the 125th Street Station and the Bowling Green Station .
42nd Street Shuttle service has been shut completely .
The Fire Department of New York -LRB- FDNY -RRB- received a call at 5:56 p.m. EDT -LRB- UTC-4 -RRB- reporting an explosion .
More than 170 firefighters were dispatched to the scene .
Witnesses reported that buildings in the nearby area shook .
This was a five-alarm response .
At least 20 people have been reported injured , and one woman , Lois Baumerich , died from a heart attack .
Two people are currently in critical condition .
There are potentially harmful materials at the scene of the explosion and HAZMAT crews are on the scene to clean up debris .
There are reports that pipes were wrapped in asbestos , but the air is being tested , and results should be available late Wednesday night .
ConEdison Workers are on the scene as well , and it appears that they are working nearby .
Emergency workers are reporting that the situation is not under control .
They are still unable to confirm why the pipe exploded due to the inaccessible nature of the scene at the source of the explosion .
The pressure of steam has subsided and the air appears to have cleared , revealing the crater .
Disruption of electricity in the surrounding area is minimal .
GCT is reported to be reopened at this time .
An area was cordoned off and people trapped in the vicinity due to fears of asbestos pollution resulting from the explosion .
According to a press conference with the mayor , the pipe involved was built in 1924 , and a likely cause of the eruption and explosion was cold water leaking into the pipe , possibly from rain or from a water pipe .
A tow truck had fallen into the crater left by the explosion , and the explosion also shattered glass on nearby buildings .

filename:<doc id="74920" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=74920" title="Emaar Properties claims Burj Dubai as world's tallest building"><paragraph:1_2_5_8_10_11_13_14_16>:SNT_LIST
July 22 , 2007
United Arab Emirates -LRB- UAE -RRB- developer Emaar Properties has claimed that their Burj Dubai commercial and residential tower , currently under construction , has become the world 's tallest building , reaching a height of 512.1 metres -LRB- or 1,680 feet -RRB- and 141 storeys .
The current official record holder , Taipei 101 of Taiwan , has a height of 508 metres and 101 storeys , and will retain the `` tallest building '' title for some time to come .
The Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat sets the criteria for achieving height records for buildings , and will not evaluate the Burj Dubai until construction is complete in late 2008 .
Although final height details have been kept secret by the developer , the Burj Dubai is expected to reach nearly 700 metres in height , with approximately 160 storeys .
The current record holder for the world 's tallest free-standing structure is the CN Tower in Toronto , Canada .
It has a height of 553 metres .
The Burj Dubai , therefore , would claim both records when it is completed .
Once the Burj Dubai is completed , it will have required 330,000 cubic metres of concrete , 39,000 tonnes of steel and 142,000 square metres of glass , according to Emaar Properties .
The building will have 56 lifts -LRB- elevators -RRB- that can move at a rate of speed of 1.75 to 10 metres per second .
Dubai is undergoing a construction boom currently with the Burj Dubai as the planned centrepiece of a $ US20 billion project , which will eventually realize some 30,000 apartments and boast the world 's largest shopping mall .
There have been criticisms of the working conditions for construction workers in the UAE .
A majority of the estimated 500,000 construction workers in the UAE are foreign workers from India , Pakistan and Bangladesh .
In a 2006 report on the UAE 's treatment of migrant workers , entitled `` Building Towers , Cheating Workers '' , Human Rights Watch documented abuses in UAE such as , `` extremely low wages , several years of indebtedness to recruitment agencies for fees that UAE law says only employers should pay , the withholding of employees ' passports , and hazardous working conditions that result in apparently high rates of death and injury . ''
In October of last year , Human Rights Watch delivered specific recommendations to the UAE government for improvement of working conditions .
The UAE government acted swiftly on the report and put in place several improvements , which were applauded by Human Rights Watch .
However , the salaries of migrant construction workers remain in the range from $ 106 to $ 250 per month , while the national average wage is over $ 2,000 per month .
Trade unions remain illegal in the UAE .

filename:<doc id="76460" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=76460" title="Home video captures alleged UFOs in Haiti"><paragraph:1_2_5_8>:SNT_LIST
August 11 , 2007
A video has surfaced on the website "LiveLeak.com '' that shows what appears to be more than a dozen Unidentified flying objects -LRB- UFOs -RRB- in a Haitian neighborhood .
The video was reportedly filmed on August 6 and was uploaded to `` LiveLeak '' on August 10 , then hosted on "YouTube.com '' .
It is not known who filmed the alleged UFOs .
`` Wikinews '' has attempted to contact the uploader of the video by e-mail , but has not yet received a response .
The beginning of the video appears to show two large UFOs flying over a woman who is taping the objects with a video camera .
The objects , shaped like flowers when viewed from the ground , make a faint roaring noise as they pass over .
They continue to fly towards a mountain range where they fly in formation to meet up with what look likes to be more than 12 other UFOs .
The video then stops .
One website is dubbing the video as a fake , saying that it 's using Computer-generated imagery -LRB- CGI -RRB- .
One image on the website AboveTopSecret.com claims that the images of palm trees in one snapshot of the video are multiple copies of a single template .
Another examination apparently shows that the UFOs are pasted in over the video .

August 23 , 2007
Two teenagers , aged 14 and 18 , have been arrested on suspicion of the murder of an 11-year-old boy .
The boy , identified by detectives as Rhys Jones , was shot last night in the Croxteth area of Liverpool , on his way home from playing football , by a hooded youth .
The police are expecting to make further arrests during the week .
Merseyside Police have said the youths , both males , are also from the Croxteth area .
They have since been bailed , and the police are now looking for a person aged 13 to 15-years-old .
There is some speculation that a gang known as the `` Croxteth Crew '' may have been involved .
Bernard Hogan-Howe , Merseyside Police Chief Constable , has made it clear that the police are still considering other leads , saying : `` There have been two arrests in this case , but that does n't prove anything .
The principal thing I need to get over to the public is we need your help , and we are not yet at all certain as to who committed this crime . ''
He went on to state the police are looking for both the killer and the person who provided the weapon .
PM Gordon Brown has described the incident as a `` heinous crime that shocked the whole of the country '' , while Home Secretary Jacqui Smith said she is `` shocked and saddened to hear about this tragic shooting '' .
They both joined calls for the local community to cooperate fully with the police .
The leader of Liverpool City Council , Warren Bradley , has called for `` a summit consisting of community leaders , police , emergency services and reformed criminals of all major cities to be held with the home secretary to find solutions to the issues we all face '' .
He says gun crime `` is an issue that all major cities face '' .

August 30 , 2007
Mahatma Gandhi 's grandson , Arun Manilal Gandhi , was interviewed by Peter Sissons on behalf of BBC News 24 .
Peter asked what Mahatma Gandhi would have done had he seen the Al-Qaeda problem .
`` Why do n't all the Muslims , Christians and other religions have a day of fasting to show Al-Qaeda that we reject their philosophy , '' Arun Manilal Gandhi , founder of `` M.K. Gandhi Institute for Nonviolence '' , replied .
Inspired by Arun Gandhi 's words , Heidi Hog , from United Kingdom , and Mike Wacht , from Orlando , Florida , began a foundation for a peace movement , `` Fast for Freedom 8 · 8 · 8 '' .
Heidi Hog turned inspiration into action launching -LSB- the -RSB- `` Fast for Freedom 8 · 8 · 8 '' campaign .
`` I maybe simplistic but sometimes its the simple things that need to be addressed , '' Heidi H. says .
Heidi represents -LSB- the -RSB- Hogshead.tv Publicity Committee and works in distributing the truth .
`` Funny to think that the people who suffer the most are the ones without the chance to voice their opinion , '' Heidi said .
Mike Wacht works in public relations and marketing , focusing on transportation and construction .
He is a member of the 511 Deployment Coalition and designer of `` Fast for Freedom 8 · 8 · 8 '' logo .
`` I want to reach the whole world and let the displaced and unfortunate know they are not forgotten .
It 's been an inspiration and a small attempt to make a difference .
I 've never tried to start a world-wide movement before , so I 'm fumbling through with a little imagination and a lot of faith , '' said Mike W. Mike W. and Heidi H. have never met in person and hope to be examples of how effortless strangers can unite together .
A worldwide fast on August 8 , 2008 is proposed , beginning at midnight for a 24-hour period .
Fasting is practised in many religious traditions and spiritual practices .
Heidi H. and Mike W. advocate `` Fast for Freedom 8 · 8 · 8 '' as a way for people to share in the experience .
`` It 's not about disarming the world or banning armies and guns and weapons of mass destruction .
It 's about one day denying food , greed , arrogance , and violence , '' said Mike W .
The proposed day of action , August 8 , 2008 , has generated many supporters , according to Heidi H. and Mike W. `` There is a fresh buzz about encouraging people in a one-day peaceful fast from all nations to participate worldwide against war , famine , starvation , and aggressive secret governments . ''

March 2 , 2008
United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon has deplored Israel for using excessive force in the Gaza Strip after troops killed 61 people Saturday including eight children , the bloodiest day for Palestinians since the 1980s .
Addressing the Security Council , Ban condemned Israel 's excessive use of force , but also criticised Palestinian rocket attacks .
`` I condemn Palestinian rocket attacks , and call for the immediate cessation of such acts of terrorism , which serve no purpose , endanger Israeli civilians , and bring misery to the Palestinian people .
I call for an end to these attacks , '' said Ban .
`` While recognising Israel 's right to defend itself , I condemn the disproportionate and excessive use of force that has killed and injured so many civilians , including children ... I call on Israel to cease such attacks , '' Ban continued .
However , there was no sign that the Israeli government is willing to stop an offensive that put more troops in Gaza on Sunday than since Israel ended a 35-year occupation in 2005 .
The offensive comes in response to a recent number of Palestinian rocket attacks including one on Wednesday which killed an Israeli student in the town of Sderot .
There have been calls by Libya to agree to a draft that would condemn Israel 's killing of civilians ; however , diplomats believe that it will not pass unless it is amended to mention Palestinian rocket fire .

March 13 , 2008
Members of Australia 's Health Services Union -LRB- HSU -RRB- will go on strike in Victoria next week in a dispute over stalled wage and career structure negotiations .
Over 5000 physiotherapists , speech pathologists and radiation therapists will walk off the job next week , effectively closing the state 's 68 largest health services .
The strike will force the closure of intensive care units and emergency departments across the state .
It is feared the strike could continue into Easter .
National secretary of the HSU , Kathy Jackson said admissions would be crippled , while intensive care patients would have to be evacuated to New South Wales , Tasmania and South Australia as hospitals will not be able to perform tests or administer treatment .
`` When an ambulance shows up you ca n't admit a patient without an X-ray being available , you ca n't intubate them and you ca n't operate on them , '' she said .
`` If something goes wrong in an ICU you need to be able to X-ray , use nuclear medicine or any diagnostic procedure , '' said Ms Jackson .
Ms Jackson said the HSU offered arbitration last year , but the state government refused .
`` They 're not interested in settling disputes , they hope that we are just going to go away . ''
`` We 're not going away , we 've gone back and balloted the whole public health workforce in Victoria , those ballots were successful , 97 percent approval rating , '' she said .
The HSU is urging the government to commence serious negotiations to resolve the dispute before industrial action commenced .
The government has offered the union a 3.25 per cent pay increase , in line with other public sector workers but the union has demanded more , but stopped short of specifying a figure .
Victorian Premier John Brumby said the claim would be settled according to the government 's wages policy .
`` The Government is always willing and wanting to sit down and negotiate with the relevant organisations ... we have a wages policy based around an increase of 3.25 per cent and , above that , productivity offset , '' he told parliament .
The union claims it is also arguing against a lack of career structure , which has caused many professionals to leave the health service .
Ms Jackson said wages and career structures in Victoria were behind other states .
Victorian Opposition Leader Ted Baillieu said he was not in support of the proposed strike and called on the government to meet with unions .
`` There could not be a more serious threat to our health system than has been announced today . ''
`` We now have to do whatever is possible to stop this strike from proceeding , '' he said .
The opposition leader will meet with the union at 11:30 AM today .
Victorian Hospitals Industry Association industrial relations services manager Simon Chant said hospitals were looking at the possible impact and warned that patients may have to be evacuated interstate if the strike goes ahead .

March 17 , 2008
Indonesian budget airline Adam Air has been given a three-week ultimatum by the authorities to prove its economic stability or its license will be revoked , said Transportation Minister Jusman Djamal .
This is because major financial difficulties have become apparent today , with two major shareholders pulling out of the company .
PT Global Transport Service -LRB- GTS -RRB- and Bright Star Perkasa , who between them own a 50 % stake in the company , have decided to sell back all their shares to their original owners , who control the other 50 % .
These are the family of founder Adam Suherman and Sandra Ang .
The companies invested in the airline last year , when the company was struggling after the New Year 's Day disappearance of Adam Air Flight 574 with 102 on board .
The Boeing 737 -LRB- B737 -RRB- was ultimately determined to have crashed into the sea near Sulawesi , and all on board are presumed dead .
Shortly afterwards , Adam Air Flight 172 , another B737 , snapped in half during a hard landing , but held together preventing fatalities .
These were not the first serious accidents for the company , as in February 2006 Flight 782 became lost for several hours after navigation systems failed and the plane entered a radar blackspot , forcing a subsequent emergency landing many miles from the intended route .
The given reasons for the withdrawal are a lack of improvement in safety and financial irregularities .
The company has now also defaulted on debt payments to aircraft lease firms , resulting in 12 of their 22 planes being seized , and has cut the number of routes served from 52 to 12 .
The remaining ten planes are also in default and at risk of seizure .
Adam Air owes leasing companies US$ 14 million compared to free capital of $ 4.8 million of free capital .
They have agreed to buy back shares gradually for $ 11 million -LRB- 100 billion rupiah -RRB- , $ 6 million less than the investment firms paid for them .
The cost difference will be borne by Harry Tanoesoedibyo 's family , the founder of PT Bhakti Investama , of which GTS is a wholly owned subsidiary .
The companies have also lost 157 billion rupiah worth of investment in the company since the April 2007 deal .
9,325 Rupiah are currently worth US$ 1 .
GTS director Gustiono Kustianto said that `` Since we joined , our priority has been safety '' but that Adam Air 's management had been unresponsive to pressure from the new investors to improve its poor record .
Last weeek another company B737 shot off the runway during landing , damaging the plane and injuring five .
Lawyer Marx Andryan of Hotman Paris Hutapea , representing the investment firms , said they have documents proving the company has not adequatly seen to pilot recruitment , maintenance and insurance .
Suherman said `` We have defaulted and the investors have done nothing about it .
We 'll continue to operate as long as we have planes , '' adding that there are no current plans to declare bankruptcy .
`` Out of 22 planes , now we only have 10 because 12 of them have been declared in default .
The other 10 have been declared in default as well , but I 'm still trying to work out a way to restructure the payments , '' he told `` Reuters '' .
He went on to say that a cash injection is required , and that `` There is a possibility starting on March 21 Adam Air will temporarily cease operations until there is a decision from the shareholders regarding the insurance premium . ''

The National Assembly of Pakistan has elected Fahmida Mirza of the Pakistan Peoples Party -LRB- PPP -RRB- as its first female speaker , weeks after the general elections which ousted President Pervez Musharraf 's party and gave the PPP the most seats in Parliament .
Mirza , a former medical doctor who has previously served three terms in the National Assembly , was the joint candidate of the PPP , the Pakistan Muslim League -LRB- N -RRB- -LRB- PML-N -RRB- , the Awami National Party -LRB- ANP -RRB- , and other allied parties .
She received 249 votes out of the 324 who were present .
Her main rival candidate , Israr Tareen from the former ruling party Pakistan Muslim League -LRB- Q -RRB- -LRB- PML-Q -RRB- , received only 70 votes .
The result was announced by Chaudhry Amir Hussain , the outgoing speaker .
`` Fahmida Mirza is declared to have been elected speaker of the National Assembly , '' he said , as other Parliament members pounded their desks in approval .
`` This is my third tenure in the National Assembly and I believe it is time that we all work together to address the challenges facing the country , '' Mirza told reporters .
`` I am sure we will be able to face these challenges with the support of parliamentarians , our people and Pakistani media . ''
Shah Mahmood Qureshi , a central PPP leader , said , `` The election of Fahmida Mirza as speaker will be a big step towards the empowerment of women in Pakistan . ''
Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi , parliamentary leader of the pro-Musharraf PML-Q , told Mirza , `` This is a big test and I hope that with the honour that Allah has bestowed upon you , you will be able to live up to expectations . ''
Later , in elections for the deputy speaker , PPP candidate Faisal Kundi defeated Khush Bakhat Shujaat of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement , which is allied with the PML-Q .
The coalition government headed by the PPP has yet to name a Prime Minister , but they are expected to announce their nomination in the next few days .
Party insiders say the prime minister , who will be named by Benazir Bhutto 's son Bilawal Bhutto Zardari , will only hold office for a few months until Bilawal 's father , Asif Ali Zardari , becomes eligible for the post .

March 19 , 2008
`` Wikinews '' held an exclusive interview with author and filmmaker John Gaspard .
His films `` Resident Alien '' , `` Beyond Bob '' and `` Grown Men '' , besides opening to positive critical response , were all made on very low budgets ; costing around US$ 30,000 .
He says this is because `` I despise the process of trying to raise money to finance movies . ''
He has also written several books on filmmaking , most notably `` Digital Filmmaking 101 '' .
He says that it was `` originally ... a series of notes to ourselves , to remind us of the steps we took to make a feature for very little money .
We later expanded those notes into a complete book to provide beginning filmmakers with the tools they would need to make a feature for what most Hollywood films spend on coffee and rolls . ''
Gaspard has written two other books as well .
`` Fast , Cheap and Under Control : Lessons Learned From the Greatest Low-Budget Movie of All Time '' features interviews with some of the world 's most well known low budget filmmakers , including B-movie king Roger Corman and actor-turned-director Tom Noonan .
`` Fast , Cheap and Written that Way : Top Screenwriters on Writing for Low-Budget Movies '' features interviews with successful screenwriters who have written for low budget films .

April 2 , 2008
At 08:01 GMT -LRB- 01:01 local time -RRB- this morning , the United States Air Force launched a Minuteman III missile on a test mission from Launch Facility 09 at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California .
Due to a large number of delays , this is the first time that a Minuteman missile has conducted an operational test in over a year .
The missile flew 6,759 kilometres -LRB- 4,200 miles -RRB- downrange on a sub-orbital trajectory , to the Kwajalein Atoll test site in the Marshall Islands .
The apogee reached has not yet been released , however typical Minuteman launches reach between 1,000 and 1,300 km .
The mission , which was designated GT-196GM , or `` Glory Trip 196GM '' , was conducted to test the missile 's operational capabilities .
The missile flew with a single MK .21 re-entry vehicle , which would be used to carry a nuclear warhead if the missile were launched in hostile circumstances .
The next operational test of a Minuteman III is scheduled for early August .

April 16 , 2008
A Pegasus-XL carrier rocket , air-launched by a Lockheed L-1011 TriStar flying from Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands , has placed the much-delayed C/NOFS satellite into a low Earth orbit .
C/NOFS , which stands for Communications/Navigation Outage Forecasting System , will investigate and forecast scintillations in the Earth 's ionosphere , which are responsible for degradation of signals from navigation and communications satellites .
It was originally scheduled to launch in 2003 , but owing to a string of delays , it was finally launched at 17:01 GMT today .
It will be operated by the Air Force Research Laboratory and Space Test Program offices of the United States Air Force .
The launch was conducted by Orbital Sciences Corporation .
It is the first launch of a `` Pegasus '' rocket in almost a year .
The next `` Pegasus '' is scheduled to launch in July , with NASA 's IBEX satellite .
The launch of C/NOFS is the 17th launch to orbit this year and the 39th orbital `` Pegasus '' launch .

April 18 , 2008
A man was arrested in Bristol , United Kingdom on suspicion of terrorism Friday .

Parts of the city were evacuated .
The person who was arrested is believed to be 19 years old .
Assistant chief constable for Avon and Somerset police commented on the incident .
`` During yesterday and overnight , Avon and Somerset Constabulary have been co-ordinating a number of covert inquiries , `` she said .
`` As a result , a 19-year-old man was arrested yesterday afternoon under the Terrorism Act 2000 , '' she continued .
`` It is unlikely that those who have been evacuated will be able to return to their homes until much later today at the earliest but I am sure that they will understand that this inconvenience is to ensure their safety and welfare and I can only repeat we are extremely grateful for their co-operation . ''
A `` Wikinews '' reporter visited the nearest main road , Henleaze Road in the hours after the arrest , to report on the incident .
It was noted that there was a significantly higher number of police vehicles in the area , compared to the usual figure .
The `` Wikinews '' reporter also noted that there were several reporters gathered around the local police station .
A large police van was also noticed outside the police station .
Avon and Somerset police hosted a press conference in which they released a statement .
The beginning of the statement can be found below : `` BBC News '' has reported that the arrested man was a follower of the religion of Islam .
This has not yet been confirmed .
By 1700 Local Time -LRB- 1600 UTC -RRB- , the police presence in the area surrounding Henleaze Road had decreased dramatically .
People on Henleaze Road this evening told `` Wikinews '' that they were , among other things , `` shocked '' and `` surprised , '' by today 's events .

filename:<doc id="104299" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=104299" title="Chinese hackers call off attack on CNN website"><paragraph:1_3_5_8_12_16>:SNT_LIST
April 19 , 2008
A group of Chinese nationalist hackers calling themselves `` Revenge of the Flame '' has temporarily called off a planned attack on the website of news channel CNN .
The group had organized the attack in protest of the network 's coverage of unrest in Tibet , which they believed was overly critical of China and biased in favor of the Tibetans .
The group planned to take the CNN website offline by flooding its servers with internet traffic , in what is known as a distributed denial of service -LRB- DDoS -RRB- attack .
The attack was scheduled for April 19 , but was canceled because too many others had become aware of their plan .
`` Our original plan for 19 April has been canceled because too many people are aware of it and the situation is chaotic , '' the group said in a statement released April 17 .
However , they repeatedly stated that the attack would commence on another day .
`` The attack has n't been cancelled ; it will be carried out on an unspecified day in the near future , '' the statement read .
Despite the attack being called off , some had apparently decided to proceed earlier than expected .
On Thursday , CNN reported attempts to disrupt its website , prompting countermeasures that affected the site 's availability for some users in Asia .
`` CNN took preventative measures to filter traffic in response to attempts to disrupt our Web site , '' the network said in a statement .
`` A small percentage of CNN.com users in Asia are impacted . ''
CNN and other Western media outlets have come under criticism from Chinese viewers in the past weeks for their coverage of China and Tibet .
The movement against CNN has spawned the website anti-cnn.com , which aims to `` expose the lies and distortions in the western media '' .
The site generates over five million hits a day , according to its founder , Rao Jin .
The movement also spawned the slogan `` Do n't be too CNN '' , which is the basis for two songs that have become increasingly popular among Internet users in China .
In a statement , CNN responded to the criticism of their reporting .
`` CNN 's reputation is based on reporting global news accurately and impartially , '' the network stated , `` while our coverage through the use of words , images or video always reflects a wide range of opinions and points of view on every story . ''

April 23 , 2008
Hillary Clinton , one of the two remaining contenders for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States has won the Pennsylvania Democratic primary .
With 99.51 % of districts reporting , Clinton received 1,238,232 votes -LRB- 54.6 % -RRB- and Obama got 1,030,703 -LRB- 45.4 % -RRB- .
This translates to an estimated 84 delegates for Clinton and 74 for Obama .
Additionally , Pennsylvania has 29 unpledged `` superdelegates '' .
Despite her win , she still lags behind frontrunner Barack Obama in the number of delegates .
Neither candidate has the needed number of delegates to clinch and secure the Democratic Party 's presumptive nomination spot .
Clinton now has an estimated 1,593 1/2 committed delegates , while Obama has 1,721 1/2 .
2,024 delegates are needed for an outright win .
306 delegates are still up for grabs at the remaining primaries , caucuses and conventions .
Among the 794 `` superdelegates '' , Clinton holds the edge .
488 of them have publicly endorsed candidates .
256 say they will vote for Clinton , while 232 say they will choose Obama .
306 have not committed their votes .
`` Some people counted me out and said to drop out .
But the American people do n't quit , and they deserve a president who does n't quit either , '' Clinton told supporters at a rally last night in Philadelphia .
`` I 've won the states that we have to win , Ohio , now Pennsylvania , '' Clinton said in an interview on CNN .
`` If you ca n't win the states we have to win in the fall , maybe that says something about your general-election appeal . ''
This morning on ABC 's `` Good Morning America '' program , Clinton said the result is `` fresh information '' for uncommitted `` superdelegates '' that shows `` the broad base of coalition that I put together is exactly what we are going to need to have in the fall . ''
`` Now it 's up to you , Indiana , '' said Barack Obama at a rally in Evansville , Indiana , where he spent election night .
`` You can decide whether we 're going to travel the same worn path , or whether we will chart a new course . ''
The Indiana Democratic primary is on May 6 , 2008 .
In the Pennsylvania Republican primary , John McCain , who is already the presumptive nominee for the Republican Party , received 72.7 % of the vote , while Ron Paul got 15.9 % and Mike Huckabee rounded out the field with 11.4 % .

filename:<doc id="104606" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=104606" title="Helen Thomas probes White House on torture; online community sends flowers"><paragraph:1_2_5_7_8_9_12_13_18>:SNT_LIST
April 25 , 2008
On Wednesday , long-time White House correspondent Helen Thomas questioned White House Press Secretary Dana Perino bluntly and repeatedly about United States President George W. Bush 's recent confirmation that he had approved CIA interrogation policies that included waterboarding .
`` Where is everybody ? ''
asked Thomas , apparently frustrated with lack of attention her colleagues had given the issue .
The community at the social news site reddit answered `` Here we are '' ; a message they plan to deliver along with several thousand dollars in flowers and other gifts .
Thomas 's questions became front-page news on `` reddit '' this morning , via a `` Think Progress '' blog post that includes a C-SPAN 2 video clip of Thomas during yesterday 's press briefing .
Noting the president 's repeated assertion that the U.S. does not torture , Thomas characterized the authorized interrogation techniques as torture .
`` Now he has admitted that he did sign off on torture , he did know about it , '' said Thomas , `` so how do you reconcile this credibility gap ? ''
Perino reiterated that the `` United States has not , is not torturing any detainees in the global war on terror . ''
Whether waterboarding , among other techniques , should be categorized as torture has been a subject of political contention in recent months .
Thomas was unequivocal , responding to Perino : `` That 's not my question .
My question is , why did he say publicly ` we do not torture ' , when he really did know that we do ? ''
In appreciation of the reporter asking `` A REAL QUESTION '' -LRB- as the headline put it -RRB- , reddit users -LRB- known as `` redditors '' -RRB- have collected over $ 3,000 for the purchase of flowers , edible arrangements and other gifts .
Several ` redditors ' also claimed to have ordered flowers for Thomas independently .
The bulk of the money was collected through Chipin.com , on a donation page created Micah Fitch , a musician and graphic designer in Minneapolis , Minnesota .
As of publication , the site registered 400 contributors for a total of $ 3,125 .
Fitch also created a wiki , `` FlowersWiki '' , for organizing the gift purchases and selecting messages to go with them .
A large delivery to the Washington D.C. offices of Thomas 's employer Hearst Newspapers is being scheduled for Friday morning .
One redditor claims that a friend who works for The Daily Show is pitching the story to the show 's staff .
This is not the first time Thomas has received a high-volume flower gift .
In 2006 , an e-mail campaign that began on the political website Democratic Underground collected over $ 2000 and resulted in delivery of 108 dozen roses .

May 1 , 2008
Moss Landing , California , United States is a small community on the shore of Monterey Bay .
In April of 2007 , the community installed a dock for visitors at a cost of US$ 800,000 .
Since then , the new dock has been taken over by hundreds of sea lions .
Harbor officials estimate there are more than 400 of them on the dock .
The gangway , which leads to the dock , is closed .
A sign reads : `` Do not approach .
Vicious Sea Lions . ''
Boaters and kayakers can not use the new dock .
`` Wikinews '' observed kayakers trying to paddle as far away as possible from the dock and its new residents .
Quite a few tourists were seen stopping to take pictures of the new Moss Landing attraction .
Harbor officials have tried to make the sea lions leave , but the sea lions seem to like it there .
They can be seen fighting and playing all around the dock in the harbor .
Sea lions in California are protected under the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act .
They are generally found in shallow waters of coastal areas of both with abundant food resources .
Visitors might also find sea otters at Moss Landing , as Wikinews did .
Sea otters are more rare and much harder to find in the wild than sea lions .
While the recovery of the sea otter is considered an important success in marine conservation , it remains an endangered species .
The otter is also considered to be a keystone species .
Parallels could be drawn between Moss Landing and the docks at Pier 39 in San Francisco , which were famously taken over by sea lions in 1990 and has become a familiar tourist attraction .
It remains to be seen if sea lions become a permanent part of Moss Landing .

May 14 , 2008
Queen Elizabeth II , the UK head of state , recently arrived in Turkey .
She said in a speech made on arrival that she was `` delighted to be back in Turkey more than 36 years after our last visit of which we have many happy memories . ''
Her Majesty continued , `` here in 1971 , I remarked on the tremendous achievement of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk in guiding this country of rich and ancient traditions along a course towards a modern , enlightened and democratic state . ''
The Queen praised Turkey for its efforts on democracy .
`` One could hardly have imagined then the further strides that Turkey would take to become today 's confident and dynamic democracy .
In this new century , we can celebrate the links between our two countries -LSB- Turkey and the UK -RSB- as being stronger than ever . ''
A car bomb car exploded today at 3:00 AM CEST -LRB- UTC +2 -RRB- in the Basque town of Legutiano , near the barracks of the Spanish paramilitary police Guardia Civil .
A policeman died and 4 more were injured .
The Basque separatist group ETA was blamed for this attack by authorities , but no one has claimed responsibility yet .
The dead man was in a small surveillance building near the barracks , which were both destroyed by the bomb van .
Four more people , two men and two women , were injured , one of them seriously .
There were more than 40 people in the barracks at the moment of the blast .
Officials say the death toll in the recent earthquake in China has reached almost 15,000 .
The news comes as 2,000 of the nation 's troops were dispatched to the Zipingku Dam to repair `` extremely dangerous '' cracks in the structure , which is upriver from Dujiangyan City , already severely hit by the disaster .
It is feared the toll will rise much further as 60,000 people are missing after the 7.9 magnitude quake in Sichuan let entire towns `` razed to the ground '' with no buildings standing , according to officials in the area .
At one destroyed school 178 children were found dead after the building collapsed while they slept inside it .
A second school at Wudu , twenty miles from the epicentre behind the White Cloud Mountain , has 130 dead children and 150 more still buried and feared dead .

May 19 , 2008
The last remaining members of the Russian doomsday group True Russian Orthodox Church emerged from a cave outside Penza Friday , after enduring the toxic stench of rotting corpses from two deceased members of their group .
Interfax quoted authorities who said that fumes from the corpses in the cave threatened the nine remaining members of the group with poisoning and intoxication .
Members entered the cave in November 2007 under instruction from their leader Pyotr Kuznetsov , and were under the belief that the world was coming to an end in May of this year .
Thirty-five members of the group entered the underground cave , 650 km -LRB- 400 miles -RRB- south-east of Moscow , in November in order to wait for the end of the world .
The group members threatened mass suicide by igniting gasoline canisters if authorities attempted to intervene and remove them .
When Russian Orthodox priests were brought in to negotiate in November , the group members refused to speak with them .
The group 's leader Kuznetsov , a trained engineer , instructed his followers not to listen to the radio or watch television .
True Orthodox Church is a splinter group of the Russian Orthodox Church .
Members believe that bar codes are Satanic symbols and refuse to eat processed food .
In November Kuznetsov , 43 , was arrested and charged with setting up a religious organization associated with violence .
In March , Kuznetsov attempted to commit suicide by banging his head with a log , after the spiritual leader realized he was wrong about his prophecy of apocalypse .
After undergoing a psychiatric evaluation , Kuznetsov was determined to be schizophrenic .
`` It was an attempted suicide .
Pyotr put his head on a tree stump and started hitting his head with a log , '' said Oleg Melnichenko , deputy goveror of the Penza region .
According to local prosecutor Grigori Zhitenev , Kuznetsov attempted to commit suicide because `` the end of the world has not come '' .
When the roof collapsed approximately a month ago , 24 members including four children left the cave .
A male member of the group who had previously left the cave told `` Russia Today TV '' that one female member died of malnutrition while fasting , and another female member died of cancer .
Both of their bodies were buried in a hole in the cave .
Emergency workers discovered the bodies while trying to shore up supports in the cave which previously underwent partial cave-ins due to melting snow .
The bodies of the two dead women were exhumed after the nine members of the group left the cave , and forensic tests were conducted on the bodies .
`` We could smell the stench through ventilation holes .
As we pulled out the dead bodies , we suggested the others leave and they agreed , '' said local official Vladimir Provotorov in a statement quoted by Interfax .
Provotorov said authorities believed the remaining members of the group would be poisoned by the toxic fumes of the decomposing bodies of the two dead females .
There was `` a real threat of poisoning from toxic corpse fumes , '' said Provotorov .
Oleg Melnichenko said the stench of the corpses drove the remaining members out of the cave .
According to the `` International Herald Tribune '' , the Penza regional Prosecutor General 's Office confirmed the Interfax report .
A physician is examining the eight women and one man that emerged from the cave on Friday , and prosecutor 's office spokeswoman Tatyana Ostrovskaya said authorities are in the process of deciding whether or not to pursue criminal charges related to the two dead women .
`` We are examining the bodies to see if we will open a criminal case , '' said Ostrovskaya .
The majority of the members of the True Russian Orthodox Church still believe that the world will soon end , and await the apocalypse in the village of Nikolskoye in a cottage owned by their leader Kuznetsov .

May 27 , 2008
Maxime Bernier , Canada 's Minister of Foreign Affairs , resigned after it was revealed that he left classified materials at an insecure location .
Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced Bernier 's resignation in Ottawa on Monday .
Bernier was once in a relationship with Julie Couillard , whose previous associations with the controversial Hells Angels biker group were reported in recent months .
In an interview with French-language television network TVA , Couillard indicated that Bernier left behind some designated secret documents at her residence .
She returned these to the federal government upon advice from a lawyer .
Opposition politicians were critical of Harper and his handling of the matter , noting that until today the Prime Minister downplayed security concerns surrounding Bernier 's relationship with Couillard .
Negative reaction to Bernier 's resignation quickly came from Liberal party house leader Ralph Goodale and NDP leader Jack Layton .
Bernier has a track record of controversy as a member of the Harper government .
Last week , he hastily promised Canadian military aircraft for relief efforts in cyclone-ravaged Burma , although the aircraft in question were already occupied elsewhere .
The Canadian government was forced to rent a Russian aircraft to fulfill Bernier 's promise .
Bernier also received criticism earlier this year after he made public comments calling for the removal of an Afghanistan governor from office .
David Emerson will assume Bernier 's Foreign Affairs duties , at least for the short term .

May 31 , 2008
FIFA , the world 's governing body for football -LRB- soccer -RRB- , and the European Union are set to collide over the controversial 6 +5 Rule .
The problem is that FIFA wants to limit the number of foreign players in the starting 11 to a maximum 5 players per side while the European Union allows free movement of workers making FIFA 's 6 +5 Rule illegal within the European Union .
Despite the legal issue about the 6 +5 Rule within the European Union , FIFA President Sepp Blatter presented the 6 +5 Rule to FIFA Congress where the member national associations of FIFA would vote on examining the issue further .
The FA in was quoted on their website saying , `` At today 's meeting of the FIFA Congress in , The FA voted in favour of further exploration of the `` 6 +5 '' rule proposed by FIFA President Sepp Blatter . ''
The FA further said , `` The resolution , adopted overwhelmingly by the Congress , requested that the FIFA and UEFA Presidents work with key figures within the world of sport to examine how the proposal might work within the limits of the law . ''
The FA , the national association for England , indicated that having more `` high-quality English players '' is an `` absolute priority . ''
A reservation of the FA is the legality of the 6 +5 Rule but they `` welcome further exploration of its legality . ''
On May 8 , the European Union voted against the 6 +5 Rule and have indicated that they will take legal action against any national association within the European Union that introduces FIFA 's 6 +5 Rule .
Depending if and how fast FIFA gets their way , the 6 +5 rule can be implemented as soon as 2012 with smaller variations leading the way to 2012 .
The Telegraph took a look at the last Day of the FA Premier League to see how clubs matched up with the 6 +5 Rule .
The table below shows 2 sets of results .
According to the Telegraph , British players might be exempted from the rule meaning that English teams might not be penalized for fielding Scottish , Welsh and Northern Irish players .
The same would apply for teams in Scotland , Wales and Northern Ireland .

June 3 , 2008
According to the Associated Press -LRB- AP -RRB- , 2008 United States Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has told lawmakers in New York that she is `` open to being Obama 's vice presidential candidate '' .
Earlier , the AP reported that Clinton would concede her race for the White House tonight during a speech in New York City , something her campaign denied .
`` The AP story is incorrect .
Senator Clinton will not concede the nomination this evening , '' said Clinton campaign officials in a statement to the press .

June 4 , 2008
According to the Movement for Democratic Change -LRB- MDC -RRB- party in Zimbabwe , opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai has been detained by police after they stopped his convoy .
The MDC convoy transporting Tsvangirai was stopped by a roadblock at 10:00 UTC north of Bulawayo .
Tsvangiarai and his people have been taken to a police station in Lupane , according to MDC spokesperson Nelson Chamisa .
George Sibotshiwe , a spokesperson for Tsvangirai , said , `` We are currently held up .
They are saying there 's a commanding officer whom we should wait for .
They are not saying why they are holding us up .
It 's not an arrest but illegal detention .
It appears they want to disrupt our campaign program . ''
Yesterday , while campaigning in Bulawayo , Tsvangirai said , `` Mugabe is determined to turn the whole country into a war zone in order to subvert the will of the people and steal the June 27th election by any means possible . ''

July 1 , 2008
Ever since Google Android was discussed at the 2007 Google Developer Day , and the conceptual structure of the GPhone was announced last year , mobile phone manufacturers , including Motorola , HTC , and Samsung , have been highly interested in manufacturing the GPhone .
The `` GPhone '' will be built with `` Android '' inside , which has had several issues with multi-language transformation and localization in different countries .
It was confirmed to thirty-three manufacturers that the GPhone 's launch will be postponed to 2008 Q4 or 2009 Q1 after the stability of Android is greater .
Although the postponement was confirmed , some industrial analysts commented that GPhone will be the greatest opponent for iPhone after its launch .

July 3 , 2008
United States President George W. Bush is scheduled to attend the opening ceremony of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing on August 8 , the White House said Thursday .
The visit will be part of an August trip to China , South Korea , and Thailand , where he will discuss issues such as bilateral relations , U.S.-Korean trade and North Korea 's nuclear program .
Human rights groups have appealed to Bush not to attend the Olympics , citing the Chinese government 's crackdown on Tibetan protesters as evidence of human rights abuse .
Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk and Czech Republic President Vaclav Klaus have said they will boycott the opening ceremony as a political protest .
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown says that he will not attend the opening , but he will be at the closing .
U.S. senator and former Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was among a group of senators who sent Bush a letter urging him not to attend the Olympics .
Presumptive Presidential nominees Barack Obama and John McCain have also weighed in .
Obama wants Bush to boycott the ceremony if China does n't respect human rights in Tibet and pressure Sudan on the violence in Darfur , while McCain has said that if he were President , he would n't attend .
Representatives of the Chinese government have begun talks with the Dalai Lama to ease tension between China and Tibet .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy said earlier this week that his attendance at the Olympics will depend on the outcome of these talks .
However , Bush has previously said that he would go to the Olympics to support American athletes , not to make a political statement .
`` He sees this as a sporting competition , '' said White House Press Secretary Dana Perino .
`` But at the same time , just as he will this week when he sees President Hu , he will talk to him about these important issues of human rights and especially religious freedom . ''

July 14 , 2008
Sulpicio Lines has named the companies hired to conduct salvage operations for MV `` Princess of the Stars '' , the Philippines ferry that sank on June 21 during Typhoon Fengshen , leaving over 800 passengers dead .
The Department of Transportation and Communication -LRB- DOTC -RRB- had already set a deadline of this Tuesday to name the contractor who would recover the ship .
Another important aspect is the separate recovery of chemicals on board , primarily the fuel and a 10-tonne shipment of the dangerous pesticide endosulfan by Del Monte .
The ship had also been carrying a number of other chemicals in smaller quantities , including metamedopus , carbofuran , niclosemide , and proptineb .
All of the chemicals must be removed by order of the DOTC before the vessel is recovered .
The chemical recovery is to be performed by Titan Salvage , an international firm owned by Florida 's Crowley Maritime Corporation and specialising in sunken and capsized ship recovery .
Titan will co-operate with both Sulpicio and the DOTC , and expect the project to be completed within 60 days of the contract being signed .
Once the chemicals on board are removed then the ship itself can be recovered .
Sulpicio has also named its contractor for this : Malayan Towage and Salvage Corporation -LRB- Salvtug -RRB- .
Salvtug has accepted the contract , but warned that its estimated operation cost is PHP2 .25 billion to P4 .5 billion , which is roughly equivalent to US$ 50 million to $ 100 million .
Sulpicio had previously estimated that this exercise would cost P600 million .
The high cost is a potential problem as it is unclear who will pay .
Sulpicio 's insurance does not cover salvage .
Had Sulpicio been covered with protection and indemnity -LRB- P&I -RRB- insurance this would have been covered , but this is not required in the Philippines and so Sulpicio 's insurance agreement with Oriental Assurance Corporation only covered the hull , machinery and third-party injuries and damage .
It is likely that Sulpicio will pay for the recovery of the ferry , which has a gross weight of 23,824 tons , but as the ship poses a potential environmental hazard it has been suggested that the government should pay the costs initially to ensure work is done quickly , with Sulpicio to be charged later for this .
However , for now it is unclear who will pay for the vessel 's recovery .

July 15 , 2008
For the first time a video showing the interrogation process at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp has been released .
According to reports broadcast by Canadian media , the video shows Omar Khadr , one of the prisoners , being questioned by Canadian Security Intelligence Service -LRB- CSIS -RRB- officials .
The video was filmed with a hidden camera through an air vent .
It shows an interrogation from late February 2003 and it is being released now under a court order obtained by Khadr 's lawyers .
In the video , Khadr can be seen repeatedly crying and telling officials that `` you do n't care about me . ''
Omar claimed in the video that he was receiving poor medical care .
When an official said `` I 'm not a doctor , but I think you 're getting good medical care , '' he responded by saying `` No I 'm not .
You 're not here ... I lost my eyes .
I lost my feet .
Everything ! ''
The official 's response to this was `` No , you still have your eyes .
Your feet are still at the end of your legs . ''
`` CBC News '' has reported that that Khadr 's comments about his eyes and feet are in reference to effects from the firefight in Afghanistan .
When the crying continued the questioner called for a break and said `` Look , I want to take a few minutes .
I want you to get yourself together .
Relax a bit .
Have a bite to eat and we 'll start again . ''
Khadr , who is currently aged 21 , faces life imprisonment for charges as serious as murder if he is found guilty .
He also says that he has faced torture in Bagram air base , Afghanistan .
Prime minister Stephen Harper has repeatedly rejected calls for him to ask the United States for Khadr 's return to Canada .
`` Mr. Khadr faces serious charges .
There is a judicial process underway to determine Mr. Khadr 's fate .
This should continue , '' Kory Teneycke , Communication Director at the Office of the Prime Minister , told CBC News .
`` We might also add in terms of background that the Government of Canada 's position is consistent with the previous government 's , '' Teneycke further said .
`` This is a judicial process as opposed to a political one . ''

July 18 , 2008
A fire at a Rexam Plastics factory in China has claimed the lives of three firefighters .
Nine more were injured in the accident in Shanghai 's Fengxian District .
The first emergency call was received by Shanghai Public Security Bureau 's 110 Command Center at 12:20 p.m. and reported the Jinhui Town factory as alight .
A total of fifty fire engines and around 300 firefighters were dispatched to the scene of the blaze at the Rexam Plastic Packaging -LRB- Shanghai -RRB- Co. Ltd. facility .
Shortly after 2 p.m. a fifty-metre-long structural girder collapsed onto a group of firefighters .
Those killed were crushed beneath it and died instantly .
They were identified as Yao Lei , 20 , Shi Jianhua , 31 , and Yu Hai , 27 .
The nine injured were taken to Fengxian District Central Hospital , where one was transferred to Ruijin Hospital with burns and another to Shanghai No. 6 People 's Hospital with suspected injuries to his spine .
All are said to be in a stable condition .
There were no other injuries to firefighters or the general public .
The fire was contained by 5:30 p.m. and extuinguished by 8:00 p.m. .
At its height it covered 2,000 square and smoke was spread over ten kilometres .
The area was sealed off as a petrol station was 200 metres from the area , and air and water quality tests are underway .
A nearby drinking water plant was shut down as a precaution .
Rexam employees said the fire spread rapidly because flammable raw materials and plastic products were stored in the workshop , which had most of its equipment destroyed .
Meanwhile , local authorities say the beam fell due to poor construction .
Production at the site is not expected to be affected .

Timo Glock did a brilliant job for his Toyota team , taking the second place .
He qualified in fifth place and was in third until Massa went out .
The race became the first podium finish for Timo Glock , too .
Still , his position was in danger from Kimi Räikkönen , who was racing close to Timo , but slowed down to secure his third place .
Renault drivers Fernando Alonso and Nelsinho Piquet finished fourth and sixth , respectively .
They improved from their starting positions of seventh and tenth respectively .
The Renault duo was split only by Lewis Hamilton .
The second Toyota of Jarno Trulli came in seventh .
The top eight was rounded out by pole Robert Kubica from BMW Sauber .
Two other Renault-engined cars of Mark Webber and David Coulthard -LRB- Red Bull team -RRB- -- split by Nick Heidfeld -LRB- BMW Sauber -RRB- -- were the last cars to finish on the lead lap .
TheHonda and Williams teams , as well as Giancarlo Fisichella from Force India were all lapped .

August 6 , 2008
American celebutante and businesswoman Paris Hilton has bashed a recent presidential campaign ad by 2008 U.S. presidential hopeful John McCain in which he compared his rival Barack Obama to celebrities such as Hilton and Britney Spears .
In McCain 's TV ad , it was stated that Obama was `` the biggest celebrity in the world . ''
Hilton recorded and uploaded a video to comedy website Funny or Die , in which she mocked McCain by calling him a `` wrinkly white-haired guy . ''
`` Hey America .
I am Paris Hilton , and I am a celebrity too , '' she states at the beginning of the video , but not before images of the `` Star Wars '' character Yoda and the cast of `` The Golden Girls '' are paraded across the screen apparently comparing the characters to McCain .
`` Only I am not from the olden days , and I am not promising change like ` that other guy ' .
I 'm just hot , '' remarked Hilton , adding , `` I guess I am running for president , '' since McCain 's TV ad showed her .
McCain 's advertisement , released early this week , states , `` Is the biggest celebrity in the world ready to help your family ? ''
According to the `` Boston Globe '' and video displayed on its website , the narrator then points out that `` the real Obama promises higher taxes , more government spending .
So , fewer jobs . ''
Bill Burton , a spokesman for Obama , responded to the ad : `` Is the biggest proponent of George Bush 's tired , failed policies ready to bring about change ?
Another day brings another dishonest attack from John McCain .
While Senator McCain knows that Senator Obama has proposed cutting taxes for 95 % of American families , what he 's not telling us is that he wants to give $ 4 billion in tax breaks to the oil companies , continue giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our job overseas , and provide no direct tax relief for more than 100 million middle-class families . ''
Hilton appears in good spirits in her video and even thanks McCain for endorsing her .
`` So thanks for the endorsement white-haired dude .
And I want America to know , that I am like totally ready to lead . ''

August 14 , 2008
According to Georgian officials and scattered news reports , Russian soldiers and South Ossetian paramilitaries have marched into the Georgian city of Gori .
This comes one day after a truce was made by both nations to put an end to the six-day war that has killed many and uprooted thousands .
`` Russia has treacherously broken its word , '' said Georgia 's Security Council chief Alexandre Lomaia .
Georgian officials also said that Gori was looted and bombed by the Russians , though the latter denies this claim .
An Associated Press -LRB- AP -RRB- reporter witnessed dozens of tanks and military vehicles leaving Gori in a southeast direction .
One Russian soldier jokingly said to a photographer , `` Come with us , beauty , we 're going to Tbilisi ! ''
Tbilisi is the capital of Georgia .
A CNN crew observed thousands of Georgian troops packing up and leaving Gori at high speed .
Georgia has said it was recalling the troops to defend Tbilisi .
According to the AP , a BBC reporter witnessed Russian tanks in the streets of Gori , while South Ossetians were seizing Georgian cars and looting homes .
Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili has stated that he thinks the Western response to this situation has been inadequate .
`` I feel that they are partly to blame , '' he said .
`` Not only those who commit atrocities are responsible ... but so are those that fail to react . ''
A Russian ministry of defence official told Interfax that Russian troops were in Senaki to `` prevent attacks by Georgian military units against South Ossetia . ''
`` To begin to repair the damage to its relations with the United States , Europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world , Russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis , '' US president George W. Bush said .
Sergey Lavrov , Russia 's Foreign Affairs Minister , responded to the US statement by calling Georgia `` a special project of the United States .
And we understand that the United States is worried about its project . ''
At the United Nations , Russian ambassador Vitaly Churkin said Russia would not sign a French-drafted cease-fire resolution .
`` We will look at the draft and try to bring it to a standard where it can play a role in this , '' Churkin said .

July 31 , 2009
Corazon Aquino , the 11th president of the Philippines , has died today at Makati Medical Center of complications from colon cancer .
She was 76 .
She had been in the hospital since June .
She was the first female president of the Philippines and Asia 's first female President .
She was born María Corazón Sumulong Cojuangco on January 25 , 1933 in Paniqui , Tarlac , Philippines .
She was the widow of Senator Benigno Aquino , Jr. , a leading figure in the political opposition against the autocratic rule of Dictator Ferdinand Marcos .
After her husband was assassinated upon his return from exile on August 21 , 1983 , Aquino , who had no prior political experience , became a focal point and unifying force of the opposition against Marcos .
In the 1992 Philippine elections , though eligible to run for a second term , Aquino backed her then Defense Secretary Fidel V. Ramos , Marcos ' armed forces vice-chief of staff whose defection to the Aquino party proved crucial to the popular revolution .
Ramos narrowly won with just 23.58 percent of the vote , and succeeded Aquino as president on June 30 , 1992 .
Funeral services will commence on Wednesday at 9 A.M. at Manila Cathedral .

September 14 , 2008
At least five bombs exploded in crowded markets and streets in the heart of India 's capital New Delhi on Saturday killing 30 while injuring more than 100 people .
The blasts at Ghaffar market in Karol Bagh , at Connaught Place and Greater Kailash took place in a quick succession .
In an e-mail sent to a local television news channel , a group claiming to be the Indian Mujahideen , appeared to take responsibility for the explosions .
`` In the name of Allah , the Indian Mujahideen has struck back again .
Do whatever you want .
Stop us if you can , '' the e-mail said .
The station says it received the e-mail before the explosions occurred .
Indian Mujahideen , a militant Islamist group , have claimed the responsibility of several attacks against civilian targets in India , claimed responsibility for the 2008 Delhi bombings through an e-mail sent to Indian media , which were all triggered within a 45-minute period .

The first explosion rocked Gaffar market area of Karol Bagh in central Delhi at 18:15 -LRB- IST -RRB- in which at least 20 people were injured .
The explosive was kept near a Maruti car , and resulted in a cylinder blast in an auto rickshaw , which was subsequently thrown up several feet into the air .
Immediately after , two explosions took place in Rajeev Chowk in which at least 10 people were injured .
Police and witnesses said that went off in dustbins in and around Rajeev Chowk , a shopping and dining area popular with tourists and locals in the centre of the city .
The first of these blasts occurred on Barakhamba Road , near Nirmal Tower and Gopal Das Bhavan .
The second bomb exploded in the newly constructed Central Park in the centre of the Rajeev Chowk roundabout , built above one of the main stations of the Delhi Metro .
An eyewitness reportedly saw two men place the bomb in a dustbin at Central Park .
Two explosions rocked M-Block market in Greater Kailash-I at about 18:40 -LRB- IST -RRB- , the first near the popular Prince Paan Corner , and the other near a Levi 's store .
The latter damaged 10 shops .
Relief activities have been started while security has been put on high alert across the country following the deadly blasts in the Indian capital .

September 18 , 2008
The new Interstate 35W St. Anthony Falls Bridge in Minneapolis , Minnesota , United States was opened shortly after 5 AM today .
It replaces a bridge which collapsed last year , killing 13 people .
A fire engine and ambulance were first across on each side .
In each direction , a line of State Highway Patrol cars was followed by a formation of Department of Transportation construction trucks .
A cluster of awaiting vehicles went honking across for a few minutes , then traffic returned to the sparse levels more typical of the pre-dawn period .
The September 18 opening was well ahead of the scheduled December 24 goal , earning the contractor , Flatiron-Manson , up to $ 19.6 million in performance bonuses .
The bridge is 189 feet wide , with a main span length of 504 feet and a deck height of over 100 feet above the Mississippi River .
Traffic is expected to return to previous levels of 141,000 vehicles per day on the 10 lanes .
The accelerated construction -LRB- of only 11 months -RRB- was accomplished by pouring 120 concrete sections in heated pole barns , and then lifting them all into place via a crane mounted on a river barge .
The bridge contains 323 electronic sensors for real-time monitoring of stresses and movement of the bridge components .
It is illuminated with white light-emitting diodes .

October 4 , 2008
Finnish theatrical hard rock band Lordi - who are known for their ` monster ' personas - have released a music video for the single `` Bite It Like a Bulldog '' .
The song rose to number one on the Finnish single chart .
The song is the lead single from `` Deadache '' , Lordi 's new album , which is due for release later this month .
The album 's musical style is described as similar to the band 's previous work in that it is melodic hard rock , but with a ` rougher ' quality to it and stronger horror themes .
The band 's keyboardist previously compared some of the music to that of Rob Zombie .
The band have also introduced new incarnations of their costumes , as they do for the release of each album .
According to the group 's frontman , part of the aim for the video was to showcase these to the world for the first time .
`` The modern horror film classics such as `` The Texas Chainsaw Massacre '' remake and `` Hostel '' were the starting points and the influence for the visual look , '' he told `` MTV '' .
He also explained that the intention was to produce something different with the video .
`` We wanted to achieve something that breaks the tradition of Lordi videos ... The idea was to have a video with a not-so-simple and easily understandable storyline .
We wanted the clip to focus on the feeling of the song and the new , more grotesque look of the band . ''
The video was directed by Limppu Lindberg , who has worked on graphic design with Lordi and directed videos for Finnish metal bands such as and Norther .
The video 's United States TV debut will be made tonight at 11 pm on MTV2 's `` Headbangers Ball '' .

October 9 , 2008
When 24-year-old Andrew Vactor of Urbana , Ohio , United States was convicted of violating the city 's noise ordinance , Judge Susan J. Fornof-Lippencott offered to reduce the normal fine of US$ 150 to $ 35 if he agreed to listen to 20 hours of classical music .
Fifteen minutes into the sentence the rap music fan changed his mind and paid the full fine in order to end his probation .
The sentence would have included selections from Ludwig van Beethoven , Frédéric Chopin , Johann Sebastian Bach , and Claude Debussy .
Chief Probation Officer Glenda Runkle says the department keeps three CDs for this type of sentence .
Champaign County Municipal Court Judge Fornof-Lippencott told the `` Springfield News-Sun '' she often assigns creative sentencing options .
`` I think a lot of people do n't like to be forced to listen to music .
And I think sometimes the defendants ... are put in the position the general public is put in . ''
She also selects episodes of `` Dr. Phil '' and `` The Oprah Winfrey Show '' that she considers relevant to other misdemeanor offenses and supplies copies to the probation department .
`` The idea , hopefully , is that it will inspire people not to come back for the same violation .
It offers an opportunity for them to cut down on their fines and costs and at the same time broaden their horizons . ''
Although Judge Fornof-Lippencott hopes these sentences `` might enlighten defendants '' , Vactor denied that musical taste played a role in his decision to pay the full fine .
Vactor , a student at Urbana University , told reporters he needed to leave for basketball team practice .
`` I did n't have the time to deal with that , '' he said .
`` I just decided to pay the fine . ''

October 16 , 2008
A report released by the US House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform today found that the White House had `` used the political affairs office to orchestrate an aggressive strategy to use taxpayer-funded trips to help elect Republican candidates '' during the 2006 Congressional elections .
The actions of the White House may have breached the Hatch Act , which prohibits government involvement with taxpayer dollars in political affairs .
The Office of Political Affairs coordinated the efforts , and while it has been used in the past to support political parties , the Committee called the level of involvement `` unprecedented '' and a `` gross abuse of public trust '' .
A total of 99 Republican candidates were supported by the actions .
Political Affairs requested that its officials attend events of and support key members of the 2006 -- 2007 Congressional race .
Administration officials attended a total of 425 events , including parties , fundraising dinners , speeches , and appearances with Republican candidates -- an average of more than an event each day of the election season .
A third of the events were paid for with tax dollars .
White House emails used in the report referred to the taxpayer-funded events as `` top priorities '' .
Former Political Affairs director Ken Melhman said during an investigative interview that it was a `` big part '' of his job was to `` help elect allies of the President '' .
The job was legal , he said , because it promoted executive allies .
Mehlman had discussed his actions with the White House Counsel of the time , Alberto Gonzales , who approved of the efforts .
The Committee noted that the director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy , John Walters , helped with nineteen events though his position was restricted from campaign activities .
Mehlman said that his department had worked directly with the National Republican Congressional Committee on the strategy .
They had worked together to pick `` vulnerable Republican incumbents '' , `` battleground races '' and `` places where they agreed the most help was needed '' .
The White House kept a ` target list ' of ` allies ' who were in tight races .
Investigators also questioned Sara Taylor , a former director of Political Affairs and Karl Rove aid .
According to the report , Taylor resisted questioning and `` misled the Committee about her actions '' .
Taylor said the trips were efforts to be helpful but could not remember why some were helped and others not .
The report recommended an amendment of the Hatch Act and for the Political Affairs department to be abolished .
Republican Representative Tom Davis , a senior member of the Committee , said that every administration since Eisenhower has done similar things .
He said the Democrats had set out to find banned activity and had `` feigned shock '' , calling their response `` righteous indignation '' .
A White House spokesman accused the Committee of trying to `` score political points '' , and that the report was a waste of time and taxpayer money .

October 22 , 2008
__ NOEDITSECTION __ Monday saw the latest edition of the vetted version of `` Wikipedia '' , which is aimed at educational use , go quietly online .
The extensively revised version covers over five thousand topics , targeting the eight to seventeen years age group .
Partnerships with the Shuttleworth Foundation and the Hole in the Wall project will see it distributed in South Africa and India as well as copies being available globally via the offices of SOS Children UK 's umbrella organisation , SOS Kinderdorf worldwide .
First launched in 2006 as a 4,000 article edition , the extract of `` Wikipedia '' has employed hi-tech distribution methods , as well as offering a website version which has steadily climbed up in ranking to above other reviewed `` Wikipedia '' rivals and copies ; the 2007 version was available on the BitTorrent peer to peer network to keep distribution costs down and was equivalent to a fifteen-volume printed encyclopedia .
Monday 's release is compared to a twenty-volume print edition .
Key to the process for selecting articles is the English National Curriculum and similar educational standards around the world .
The initial vision was to bring this wealth of knowledge to schools where access to the Internet was poor or unavailable , but copies of `` Wikipedia for Schools '' can be found on many first world school intranets and web servers .
Among the compelling reasons to adopt the project are the vetting and additional study materials which overcome the oft-publicised concerns many educators have with the million article plus `` Wikipedia '' that anyone can edit .
In today 's press release announcing the launch , Wikimedia Foundation Executive Director Sue Gardner expressed delight at seeing the project bring out a new version , `` Our goal is to make Wikipedia accessible to as many people as possible around the world , and SOS Children is a great partner that helps us make that happen .
Wikipedia is released under a free content license so that individuals and institutions can easily adapt , reuse and customize its content : we encourage others , like SOS Children , to do exactly that . ''
Running 192 schools in the developing world , SOS Children sees `` Wikipedia for Schools '' as a key piece in fulfilling the educational aspect of their mission .
SOS Children 's Chairwoman , Mary Cockcroft gave us an introduction and , a `` Wikipedia '' administrator himself , the charity 's CEO Andrew Cates spoke to `` Wikinews '' at length about the project .
Mary Cockcroft : SOS Children -LSB- 's Villages -RSB- is a `` club '' of member charities in 130 countries helping orphans and vulnerable children .
The club elects SOS-Kinderdorf International as secretary .
SOS is a large organisation whose members in aggregate turned over $ 1bn in 2007 , and whose projects include owning and running 192 schools and family-based care for 70,000 children .
However much of these funds are raised locally , with for example the member charities in each of India , Pakistan and South Africa raise considerably more funds in their own country than SOS UK does from the UK .
Nonetheless SOS Children UK principally raises funds to finance projects in the developing world , and has only financially small projects in the UK -LRB- such as the Schools Wikipedia , which is very low cost because of extensive use of volunteers -RRB- .
This year we expect about 80 % of our UK income will leave the UK for overseas SOS associations , and some of the remaining 20 % will pay for project oversight .
We do not spend money in the UK on Direct Mail or TV advertising .
Our UK office is involved in overseeing projects we finance and a small number of high-skilled volunteers from the UK help overseas .
However around 98 % of SOS staff worldwide are local nationals , as are most volunteers .
MC : We are deeply unhappy about the situation of children in out-of-home care in the UK .
However our care model of 168 hour-a-week resident mothers does not fit with the UK philosophy for children without parental care .
Internationally SOS always has a policy of sharing best practice and we are working to improve understanding of our way of working , which appears to us to have far better outcomes than the existing one in the UK .
Ultimately though the legal responsibility for these children lies with government and we can not remedy anything without their invitation .
Andrew Cates : I honestly can not remember who first suggested it , but it came from somewhere in the Wikipedia community rather than from the charity .
The original product was very much pitched at the developing world where the Internet is only available if at all over an expensive phone line .
I worked in West Africa 1993 - 1996 and I know well at how thirsty for knowledge people are and how ingenious they will be in overcoming technical obstacles if the need for infrastructure is removed .
AC : It was a pleasant surprise .
I do n't think we had realised what the barriers schools faced in using the main Wikipedia were .
It is n't just pupils posting material about teachers or meeting strangers : the `` Random Article '' button on every page could potentially deliver an article on hardcore porn .
We had already started when discussion broke on banning Wikipedia from classrooms and I am sure we benefited from it .
AC : It was a long and painful process , even with a really good database system .
Articles were taken into the proposal funnel from three main sources : direct proposals for inclusion from Wikipedians , lists which came from the Release Version team and proposals drawn up from working through National Curriculum subjects by SOS volunteers .
In a few cases where we felt articles were missing we asked the community to write them -LRB- e.g. Portal : Early Modern Britain , which is a curriculum subject , was kindly written just for us -RRB- : These `` proposals '' were then looked at by mainly SOS volunteers -LRB- some onwiki , some offline -RRB- .
Our offices are in the middle of Cambridge and we get high quality volunteers , who skim read each article and then compared two versions from the article history by credible WP editors a significant period apart -LRB- this picks up most graffiti vandalism which runs at about 3 % of articles -RRB- .
Once they had identified a `` best '' version they marked any sections or text strings for deletion -LRB- sections which were just a list of links to other articles not included , empty sections , sex scandals etc -RRB- .
A substantial sample of each volunteers work was then doubled checked for quality by one of two office staff -LRB- of whom I was one -RRB- .
We then have a script which does some automated removals and clean ups .
Once we had a selection we posted it to relevant wikiprojects and a few `` experts '' and got any extra steers .
AC : BitTorrent was a bit disappointing in that it got us the only substantial criticisms we received online .
A lot of people find it too much effort to use .
However for the period we offered a straight http : download we had huge problems with spiders eating vast bandwidth -LRB- the file is 3.5 G : a few thousand rogue spider downloads and it starts to hurt -RRB- .
As per last year therefore our main two channels will be free download by BitTorrent and mailing the DVDs free all over the world .
At a pinch we will -LRB- as before -RRB- put straight copies up for individuals who can not get it any other way , and we have some copies on memory sticks for on distributors .
AC : Clearly yes .
We have had a very enthusiastic reaction from schools and the teaching community .
We think every school should have an intranet copy .
We expect the Government to catch on in a few years .
That is not to say that Wikipedia is as good as resources developed by teachers for teachers such as lesson plans etc. but it is a fantastic resource .
AC : Funnily the thing I have found most amazing about Wikipedia is not widely discussed , which is the effect of Wikipedia policies on new editors .
I have seen countless extreme POV new editors , who come in and try to get their opinions included slowly learn not only that there are other opinions to consider but that elements of their own opinion which are not well founded .
Watching someone arrive often -LRB- on pages on religions for example -RRB- full of condemnation for others , gradually become understanding and diplomatic is one of the biggest buzzes there is .
The downside though is where correcting things which are wrong is too painfully slow because you need to find sources .
I was a post-doc at Cambridge University in combustion and I know the article on Bunsen burners has several really significant errors concerning the flame structure and flow structure .
But sadly I can not correct it because I am still looking around for a reliable source .
AC : I think older students have a lot to learn from becoming involved in editing Wikipedia .
AC : I would encourage people to feed back to the project online or via the charity .
The Wikipedia community set out to help educate the world and are broadly incredibly well motivated to help .
As soon as we understand what can be done to improve things people are already on the task .

More than 1,000 protesters showed up to demonstrate in front of the Los Angeles temple of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on Friday , November 7 , to protest the church 's involvement with the passing of Proposition 8 .
The proposition passed with 52 % support , and would amend the California constitution to ban gay marriage , which was recently made legal by court order .
The temple is located in Los Angeles , California .
According to a member of the Los Angeles Police Department , the Temple grounds were vandalized by protesters , and a group of apparently non-LDS Hispanic women attempting to remove critical signs from temple grounds were attacked and beaten before police stepped in and arrested those involved .
Protesters have claimed that the church 's institution made small cash donations to the Proposition 8 campaign , though no evidence has yet surfaced to corroborate the claims .
It appears that many members of the church -LRB- also known as Mormons -RRB- donated to the `` Yes on 8 '' campaign .
Jeff Flint , a strategist for Yes on 8 , has criticized the protest and related negative media placed on those Latter-day Saints who supported Proposition 8 : `` I am appalled at the level of Mormon-bashing that went on during the Proposition 8 campaign and continues to this day .
If this activity were directed against any other church , if someone put up a website that targeted Jews or Catholics in a similar fashion for the mere act of participating in a political campaign , it would be widely and rightfully condemned . ''
In addition to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , the proposition was supported by other Christian groups , the Hispanic population of California by a slight majority , and overwhelmingly by California 's African-American population .
Protests have targeted these communities as well .
F. Damion Barela , who had obtained a gay marriage to his husband five months ago , said , `` I 'm disappointed in the Californians who voted for this . ''
In particular , he was bothered that some ethnic groups supported the ban : `` To them I say , ` Shame on you because you should know what this feels like . ' ''
Protests of up to 20,000 people were held in other cities throughout the country in opposition to Proposition 8 , and some Latter-day Saints have left the church over the matter .
Several other churches have been vandalized by protesters since its passage .
Similar constitutional provisions were passed in Florida and Arizona during the election , and such provisions already exist in 27 other states , with a further 15 featuring statutory bans on same sex marriages .

filename:<doc id="116862" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=116862" title="Thaksin to return to Thai politics"><paragraph:1_3_5_7_10_14_17>:SNT_LIST
November 19 , 2008
Several reports indicate that the ousted fugitive ex-Prime Minister of Thailand , Thaksin Shinawatra , is to again become involved in the country 's politics .
He is scheduled to give another phone-in address from abroad on December 14 to supporters at the national Suphachalasai Stadium .
People 's Power Party -LRB- PPP -RRB- MP , and spokesman for the pro-government '' `` Truth Today '' '' roadshow Jatuporn Promphan said , `` Thaksin will no longer wait to be attacked , he will fight back by all means , particularly with an eye-for-an-eye strategy , from now on .
Thaksin now believes that the only way for him to survive and to live is to fight for his name '' .
Currently in exile and facing a two year jail term should he return to Thailand , Thaksin informed lawyers from his current residence in Dubai that he would not appeal the conviction for corruption in the Ratchadapisek land deal .
While lawyers claim to have prepared the needed paperwork to challenge the conviction , the deadline to do so is today .
According to the `` Bangkok Post '' , a return to politics by the ex-PM has caused some concern among PPP government members over the divisions this could cause within the country .
Thaksin still enjoys a great deal of support from the rural poor in the country 's North-East where the populist policies of his now-outlawed Thai Rak Thai -LRB- TRT -RRB- party helped win a majority .
His most vocal critics , the People 's Alliance for Democracy -LRB- PAD -RRB- have now occupied Government House in Bangkok for over three months .
The close association of the ruling PPP with the former premier has given them their own set of problems .
The party is actively contesting a case in the country 's supreme court that could see it dissolved .
The case centres around allegations of vote buying and the party 's former deputy leader , Yongyuth Tiyapairat , stands accused of paying village heads for votes .
The PPP disputes that this was a party action as opposed to the independent actions of Yongyuth and the other accused .
A ruling on the fraud from last December 's election is expected soon .
Critics of the government claim that it is simply a front for the ex-PM and his dissolved party .
The yellow-shirted PAD protesters at Government House assert that current Prime Minister , Somchai Wongsawat , Thaksin 's brother-in-law , is merely a proxy for the controversial ex-leader .
Prosecution of Thaksin on other charges , which he maintains are politically motivated , continues ; the supreme court is expected to hold a hearing next month on accusations that he is ` unusually rich ' .
This relates to the sale of the family 's stake in Shin Corporation to Temasek Holdings , the investment arm of the Singapore government .
Assets worth 76 billion baht -LRB- US$ 2.2 billion -RRB- are currently frozen over this issue .
The ex-PM escaped impeachment over the tax-free sale of Shin in February 2006 .
Thai media reports that an amicable divorce of Thaksin and his wife Pojaman in Hong Kong will have no bearing on the case or asset seizure .
Despite the split last week neither can return to Thailand without facing imprisonment ; Potjam was earlier successfully prosecuted and given a three year sentence .

December 3 , 2008
United States Republican incumbent Senator Saxby Chambliss won reelection over Democrat Jim Martin in the state of Georgia in a run-off election on Tuesday , taking 57.5 % of the popular vote to Martin 's 42.5 % .
The run-off occurred because neither Martin nor Chambliss received a majority in the general election in November .
`` People all around the world truly had their eyes on Georgia , and you have delivered tonight a strong message to the world that conservative Georgian values matter , '' Saxby Chambliss said in his victory speech .
`` Now comes the hard work . ''
`` Tonight , the voters of Georgia have spoken , '' Jim Martin said in his concession speech .
`` I accept the decision that has been made . ''
The election was widely watched because a win by Martin would have been crucial for the Democrats to achieve a supermajority in the Senate allowing them to terminate filibusters .
Under the rules of the United States Senate , senators can prolong debate indefinitely unless 60 out of the 100 senators vote to close the matter .
Without Martin , the Democrats will have 59 or 58 senators .
The exact number depends upon an ongoing recount in Minnesota between Republican incumbent Norm Coleman and Democratic challenger Al Franken .
In the past , filibusters have frequently involved coalitions of senators , and votes to stop filibusters have rarely been precisely along party lines .
The contest between Martin and Chambliss featured heavy involvement by major politicians and celebrities .
Former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin campaigned for Chambliss , while former President Bill Clinton and the rapper Ludacris campaigned for Martin .

December 23 , 2008
Fiji and New Zealand are engaged in a game of diplomatic tit-fot-tat after expelling each other 's High Commissioners .
This afternoon Fiji 's military regime expelled acting New Zealand High Commissioner to Fiji Caroline McDonald .
The New Zealand government retaliated by expelling Fiji 's High Commissioner to Wellington , Ponsami Chetty .
Both will be given a week to leave the country .
McDonald 's expulsion was announced late this afternoon by Fiji 's interim Attorney-General Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum , who said that it was `` a direct result of McDonald 's actions over the past year that have been contrary to the accepted international norms of diplomatic behaviour '' .
The Fijian government has accused New Zealand and Australia of spying on Fiji , claiming they were tapping phone lines and listening in on members of the interim regime .
The New Zealand government has denied any `` misbehaviour '' by McDonald .
The round of diplomatic tit-for-tat was sparked by growing tensions between New Zealand and Fiji over sanctions put in place in the wake of the 2006 coup .
Members of the interim regime and their immediate families are barred from entering New Zealand .
Last week the Fijian regime threatened to expel New Zealand 's High Commissioner unless the New Zealand government granted a visa to George Nacewa , the son of a senior regime official .
But yesterday the interim regime apparently backed down on its threat , issuing a statement that it would not expel McDonald and announcing that it would establish a special team to improve relations between the two countries .
McDonald is the second New Zealand diplomat expelled by Fiji .
In June 2007 then-New Zealand High Commissioner Michael Green was expelled after being accused of interfering in the country 's domestic affairs .
Last week ONE News Pacific Correspondent Barbara Dreaver was deported as she arrived to cover the crisis .
Fiji 's military overthrew the country 's elected government in a military coup in December 2006 .

January 11 , 2009
While it was just a joke , the `` Federación Nacional de Cafeteros de Colombia '' does n't find a recent `` Mother Goose and Grimm '' comic terribly funny .
In what the coffee growers association calls `` an attack on national dignity and the reputation of Colombian coffee , '' the characters in a comic strip by Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Mike Peters call into question the relationship of Colombian coffee growers and the crime syndicates of Columbia .
The cartoonist is being sued not only for `` damages -LSB- to -RSB- the intellectual heritage '' of the coffee , but also `` moral compensation .
A public manifestation , '' to the tune of $ 20 million .
At the start of a week-long series of strips , a dog character named `` Ralph '' finds out that part of chemist and food storage technician Fred Baur 's remains was buried in a Pringles can , upon his last wishes .
Baur 's best known innovation , among multiple , was the patented can and packing method for the Pringles potato chip .
The character theorizes what other remains might be interred in their food packaging .
Eventually , the dog states that `` when they say there 's a little bit of Juan Valdez in every can , maybe they 're not kidding . ''
This play on an old advertising slogan refers to fictional character Juan Valdez , created by the Federación Nacional .
In a statement Peters says : Julio Cesar Gonzalez , `` El Tiempo '' newspaper 's famous cartoonist , told the BBC that the lawsuit is `` a real waste of time . ''
In 2006 , the Federación Nacional sued Café Britt over their advertising campaign titled `` Juan Valdez drinks Costa Rican coffee .
In a counter-suit , Britt presented an affidavit from a Costa Rican man named `` Juan Valdez '' , acknowledging that he drinks Costa Rican coffee , and that the name is too generic to be exclusive .
A variety of legal challenges and charges from both sides were eventually dropped .
The phrase was actually first used in a 1999 speech by Jaime Daremblum , then-Costa Rican ambassador to the United States .
`` Mother Goose and Grimm '' appears in over 800 newspapers worldwide ; Peters has won the Pulitzer for his editorial cartoons for the `` Dayton Daily News '' .
Thirty years ago , his editorial cartoon about electricity prices featured Reddy Kilowatt , an electricity generation spokescharacter .
The `` Daily News '' defended that comic image in the United States Supreme Court , winning on the basis that `` the symbol was not selling a product '' , and thus the satire was legally permissible .
Peters drinks Colombian coffee .

January 28 , 2009
Veteran broadcaster and documentary maker Sir David Attenborough has said how he has received hate mail from creationists .
The letters tell him to `` Burn in Hell '' after not crediting God in his natural history documentaries .
Fred Drummond , director of the Scottish branch of the Evangelical Alliance , notes that this hatred is `` not representative of Evangelical Christians in the UK . ''
During an interview with BBC Radio 2 Attenborough was asked why he did not credit God in his shows , he replied saying how he always remembers a little child in East Africa with a worm burrowing through his eyeball .
The worm can not live in any other way .
`` I find that hard to reconcile with the notion of a divine and benevolent creator , '' Attenborough said .
Attenborough had previously criticised schools for teaching creationism alongside evolution .
He said it was `` terrible '' when the two were taught as equal .
He added `` Evolution is not a theory , it 's a fact , every bit as much as the historical fact that William the Conqueror landed in 1066 . ''
Attenborough joined the BBC in 1952 and created several series on the animal kingdom .
His most recent documentary , a series about Charles Darwin and evolution , is due to be broadcast in the UK at the beginning of February .

February 1 , 2009
Finnish symphonic rocker Tarja Turunen has revealed that the working title for her new album is `` What Lies Beneath '' .
The album follows on from 2007 's `` My Winter Storm '' .
`` With `` My Winter Storm '' , I chose the name of the album in the early stages and that helped me to create the concept for the album .
With the new album , I decided to do it the same way , so I searched for an inspiring title and all the songs are one way or another related to it , '' Tarja explained .
`` My Winter Storm '' was Tarja 's first album after she left the Finnish symphonic power metal band Nightwish , which she fronted .
On the day of the album 's release - November 14 , 2007 - it was certified gold in Finland for sales in excess of 15,000 copies .
On January 2 , the album was rereleased in a 2-CD format with 32 tracks , including a guest appearence by Doro Pesch and an unreleased song recorded in China that features the Beijing Philharmonic and the Qingdao Symphony Orchestra .
Regarding her next effort , she said `` In the last months I 've been writing a lot of music for my new album .
Songwriting is always an amazing learning experience , and it has been a pleasure to discuss music with different people .
`` The album process is still going on and I have more songs that are in the working .
It is sounding very promising .
The songs are absolutely more mature , wild , and emotional and they sound more me , if I can say so . ''
The album is tentatively scheduled for release in September , but Tarja has commented that this is not set in stone .
`` The biggest difference in preparing this new album is that I will be taking the time that I need until the songs are in a shape that I am happy with , '' she said `` No matter how long it takes .
I want it to be perfect for me .
No hurry ; no pressure . ''

February 1 , 2009
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has condemned the workers who staged mass walkout across the country on Friday .
Speaking to the BBC from the World Economic Forum in the Swiss skiing resort of Davos , he said that the walkouts were `` not the right thing to do '' .
Workers on industrial sites in Wales , Scotland , Cheshire , Hampshire and Teesside had left their plants and staged protests outside in sympathy with staff at Lindsey Oil Refinery in Lincolnshire , after French owner Total had given a contract to an Italian firm .
The firm brought 300 Italian and Portuguese staff into the plant .
Brown had made a speech in 2007 where he called for `` British jobs for British workers '' .
He explained to the BBC 's Politics Show that `` when I talked about British jobs , I was taking about giving people in Britain the skills , so that they have the ability to get jobs which were at present going to people from abroad '' .
The government says that European Union -LRB- EU -RRB- law makes it impossible for them to provide British jobs for British workers in the EU common market .
Earlier , the Secretary of State for Health , Alan Johnson , told the BBC that recent European Court of Justice judgments had undermined employment rights but that the government would be pushing the EU to take action if it finds that the foreign workers are ` undercutting ' UK citizens .
He described the walkouts as `` unhelpful '' , but said he understood the anger over EU workers coming to the UK `` on worse terms and conditions to actually get jobs in front of British workers on the basis of dumbing down the terms and conditions . ''
The walkouts were also condemned by the opposition Conservative Party .
Foreign affairs spokesman William Hague said that `` strikes are never the way forward '' and that his party strongly supported the free market in labour in the EU .
He said that it was `` so unbelievably ridiculous and silly '' for Brown to have made the promise on British jobs in the first place .
The government has asked the Advisory , Conciliation and Arbitration Service -LRB- ACAS -RRB- to examine the circumstances behind the strikes and see if British workers are being unlawfully excluded , as the GMB union has claimed .
Secondary or sympathetic industrial action has been illegal in the UK since the 1980s .
However , the penalties apply only to unions organizing secondary action and not to individual workers walking out .

February 2 , 2009
U.S. Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps has apologized to fans following tabloid pictures of him smoking a marijuana pipe .
The 23-year-old multiple gold medalist was pictured yesterday in the British Sunday newspaper `` The News of the World '' apparently using a `` bong '' at a University of South Carolina party he attended whilst visiting a friend on November 6 , 2008 .
He released a statement on his Facebook wall , saying `` I engaged in behavior which was regrettable and demonstrated bad judgment . ''
The statement said `` I 'm 23 years old , and despite the successes I have had in the pool , I acted in a youthful and inappropriate way , not in a manner that people have come to expect from me .
For this , I am sorry .
I promise my fans and the public - it will not happen again . ''
Marijuana is banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency -LRB- WADA -RRB- when athletes are actually competing , but not outside of that .
Phelps therefore is unlikely to face sanctions from WADA because of the incident .
However , US swimming officials and Fédération Internationale de Natation -LRB- FINA -RRB- , the international swimming federation , will comment later on their thoughts about the incident .
FINA banned Gary Hall for three months in 1998 for marijuana use .
Phelps has never failed a drugs test in his career and has previously volunteered for extra testing as part of the sport 's campaign against performance enhancing drugs .

The eighth ICC Champions Trophy for cricket in 2009 involving the top eight test playing countries could be moved away from Sri Lanka due to weather concerns during the month of October .
The tournament is scheduled for October 2009 , which is the peak rainy season and one of the wettest months in Sri Lanka .
The tournament was supposed to be played in Pakistan in September 2008 but was postponed over security issues .
The main options currently being considered are Perth , Australia , Johannesburg-Pretoria , South Africa and Dubai-Abu Dhabi , United Arab Emirates .
This was confirmed by ICC 's general manager , Dave Richardson .
He said that the cricket tournament could be played within a 12 day window in two or more grounds that are located within a short distance to reduce travel time for the teams .
He said the decision would be made during the ICC board meeting in Dubai in April .
The Supreme Court of the United States ruled in the case of Wyeth v. Levine which tested whether plaintiffs can sue pharmaceutical companies for damages caused by FDA approved medication .
The court upheld a judgment against Wyeth Pharmaceuticals for US$ 6.7 million that had been awarded to Diana Levine .
Levine , a musician , received the drug Phenergan for migrane headaches .
It was improperly administered and punctured an artery .
Gangrene set in and her right arm was amputated within several weeks .
The court voted 6-3 in favor of Levine .
The last-place team in the Scottish Premier League , Inverness CT , went to Ibrox Stadium on Wednesday hoping to avoid another loss at the hands of Rangers FC .
Inverness had already been beaten by a total of 0 - 8 in their last two meetings with the Rangers , comprised of a 0 - 3 defeat at home and a 5 - 0 thumping on their last trip to Ibrox .
It seemed Rangers would be in control again as they had a bevy of chances early on , including a shot from Saša Papac that was cleared by Grant Munro just before it crossed the goal-line .
After thirty minutes , Kenny Miller appeared to score for Rangers , but he was adjudged to be offside and his goal was disallowed .
Inverness continued to stymie the Rangers ' offence into the second half .
Their efforts were finally rewarded when David Weir was sent off in injury time for a hard tackle on David Proctor .
Ian Black converted the penalty kick .
Inverness escape the drop zone with the win and Rangers give up the lead of the SPL to Celtic FC , who defeated Kilmarnock FC by 2 - 1 .

March 12 , 2009
The crew currently of the International Space Station -LRB- ISS -RRB- was briefly evacuated to the Russian Soyuz capsule in preparation for a possible impact with space debris .
In memos published by "NASAspaceflight.com '' , the object was described as `` elliptical with a low perigee '' .
It was unclear what kind of damage the debris would have caused if it had collided with the ISS .
`` Tracking of the small piece of debris/MMOD -LRB- Micrometeoroid Orbital Debris -RRB- was initially classed as a low threat of collision with the ISS .
`` Universe Today '' reported the object as being large , while `` BNOnews '' said the object was small , about 0.009 meters .
At 12:34 EDT , `` as a contingency , NASA 's Expedition 18 Commander Mike Fincke , Russian Flight Engineer Yury Lonchakov , and NASA 's Sandra Magnus were asked to ` evacuate ' into the Russian Soyuz , which would serve as their means of departing from the Station - should it be required , '' added NASA .
Approximately 10 minutes later , after the threat had passed , the crew returned to its normal duties .

March 31 , 2009
According to data released on Tuesday , home prices in the United States plunged at the highest rates ever recorded in January .
The S&P / Case Shiller index of home prices in twenty major cities in the US announced that values of homes have slumped over 30 % since their peak in 2006 across the country .
Regional variations have resulted in larger losses in states such as Nevada and Florida .
In the year to this January , prices fell by 19 % .
`` There are very few bright spots that one can see in the data .
Most of the nation appears to remain on a downward path , '' said the chairman of S&P 's index committee , David Blitzer , in a statement .
Consumer sentiment also slumped , with the Conference Board 's index of confidence rising only slightly from last month 's all-time low , reaching 26.0 .
`` Job conditions are terrible .
There is a general sense of uncertainty because people are peppered with bad news around the world , '' said Brian Bethune , an economist for IHS Global Insight .

The Afghan youths were reported to be between the ages of 10 and 15 .
According to the newspaper `` La Repubblica '' , the children had stowed away on trailer trucks traveling from Turkey and Greece .
They had spent nights sleeping in a standing position in filthy sewer pipes after removing the manhole covers and some of them were found in a sickly condition .
There had been reports to the police of children under the Ostiense train station , a common place for the homeless to seek shelter on cold nights .
The children , who do not speak Italian , are under the care of Rome 's Social Services .

April 25 , 2009
The Russian government announced the termination of its `` counterterrorism operation '' in Chechnya effective April 16 .
According to the leader of the Russian secret service , Alexander Bortnikov , 20,000 soldiers will leave Chechnya in order to normalise the situation in the autonomous republic of Russia .
This happened on behalf of the Russian president Dmitry Medvedev who had already announced a possible withdrawal of the Russian troops at the G20 summit in the beginning of April this year .
But some forces , the special forces of Moscow 's ministry of the interior , will still stay in Chechnya .
Human rights activist Lew Ponomarjov welcomed the situation , saying that the counterterrorism situation in Chechnya had been a severe violation of human rights .
Local president Ramzan Kadyrov , son of former Chechen leader Akhmad Kadyrov who died in a bomb blast in 2004 in Grozny , is satisfied with the situation .
He is now expecting more foreign investment and a better economic growth in the area .
He declared April 16 as a future holiday in Chechnya .
Human rights organisations , on the other hand , accuse him of letting his own militia torture and kill his opponents .
In the meantime , the local president Ramzan Kadyrov has informed the heads of the regional administration about the end of the operation and advised them yesterday to let the former militants return to a peaceful civilian life , Vesti.ru reports .
But at the same time he settled that the rule should not apply to those rebels who had become extremists .
These people -- according to Kadyrov mostly living in the mountains -- would not deserve any amnesty and not any public pardon , Kadyrov said .
While there were some reports on a gun battle between Russian and rebels forces in southern Chechnya , Kadyrov said on April 21 that they had checked the reports , but did not believe that anything had changed since last week .
He questioned the timing of the reports which had appeared right after the news was spread that the Russian soldiers would leave Chechnya .
Tuesday , the operative headquarters for Chechnya claimed that the Russian special police and troops had already started an `` anti-terrorism operation '' in the Itum-Kale and Vedeno , two Chechen districts .
A spokesman said that they had `` received information that Chechen militants were preparing terrorist acts '' there .
And so they had continued with the operation .
Operations in further districts were announced on Friday , according to Voice of America .
This too was refuted by President Kadyrov .
RIA Novosti reported Saturday that four Russian soldiers were killed and at least three people injured in a number of shootings and bombings over the course of the past week .
The firefights occurred in a Village and at a checkpoint , while the explosions all occurred near a Stadium in the capital of Grozny .
The republic of Chechnya has undergone two separatist wars in the past 15 years .
The first one started in 1994 and was ended after about 21 months with the withdrawal of the Russian army .
The second one started in October 1999 with the heaviest battles in 2002 .
Still , there is a conflict between the two parties concerning the independence of the republic from Russia .
More than 100,000 people were killed in both wars , which makes about 10 per cent of the population of Chechnya .
The announcement of the withdrawal of the Russian forces is seen as an official ending of the second war .

May 9 , 2009
Corus Group , the world 's fifth largest steel producer , announced on Friday that it may be forced to mothball its steelworks in Redcar , England .
This move would threaten the jobs of the works ' 1,920 employees .
Corus may be forced to close its Teesside operations as a consortium has refused to honour a 10-year contract with Corus ' Teesside Cast Products , which accounted for 78 % of the plant 's operations .
Corus ' chief executive , Kirby Adams , said he was `` extremely disappointed that the consortium members have seen fit to take this irresponsible action . ''
Lord Mandelson , Secretary of State for Business , Enterprise and Regulatory Reform , said `` it is essential that Corus does everything it can legally , and with the government 's assistance , to reinstate the agreement '' .
Gordon Brown , the British Prime Minister , shared this view saying , `` We are doing everything in our power to ensure that the contract is upheld . ''
Mandelson also said `` we are not prepared to reconcile ourselves to the inevitable closure of this plant '' .
The leader of Redcar & Cleveland Borough Council , Councillor George Dunning , said `` Today is like being hit by a mini earthquake compared to what 's happened in the past . ''
Martin Callanan and Stephen Hughes , Tory , and Labour MEPs for North East England , supported the idea that the government should subsidise wages in the plant on a temporary basis .
Hughes and Fiona Hall , Lib Dem MEP , suggested that the government should apply to the EU 's Globalisation Adjustment Fund .
Hall said `` if the worst comes to the worst and jobs are indeed lost , I trust the Government will change its mind and support an application to the European Globalisation Fund in order to fund skills training for those who have lost their jobs . ''
This move could `` bring to an end a fine heritage of steelmaking at Teesside '' , according to Adams .
Steelworks in Teesside , which previously belonged to British Steel and Dorman Long , produced steel for famous structures like the Sydney Harbour Bridge .
Corus had said it was likely there would be a `` very significant number of redundancies '' and a 90-day consultation period is due to begin .
Corus ' owner , Tata Steel , are also facing difficulties with another UK operation , automobile company Jaguar Land Rover .

May 12 , 2009
On Sunday , Brawn-Mercedes driver Jenson Button won the FIA Formula One 2009 Spanish Grand Prix at Circuit de Catalunya , Montmeló , Spain .
This marks his fourth win this season .
His teammate Rubens Barrichello finished second , who used a more efficient three-stop fuel strategy than Sebastian Vettel from Red Bull , who finished fourth .

Both of Red Bull 's cars finished after the two Ross Brawn team cars .
Renault driver Fernando Alonso also slipped passed Massa on the last lap to secure 5th .
The top eight were closed out by two Germans : Nick Heidfeld racing for BMW Sauber and Nico Rosberg , representing Williams .

May 29 , 2009
Claiming their major trophy of the season , FC Barcelona dominated reigning champions Manchester United F.C. at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome Wednesday to win the 2009 Champions League Final 2 -- 0 .
After a shaky start , Samuel Eto'o shot the ball past Manchester United goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar in the tenth minute , the only goal Barcelona would need .
Manchester had several great chances in the opening ten minutes , with Christiano Ronaldo forcing a save from Barca keeper Víctor Valdés in the second minute .
However it was Eto'o who capitalized on his teams first real chance striking a low ball that van der Sar could get hands to .
After the goal , Barcelona settled into a smooth passing game dominating long stretches in the remainder of the first half .
At the start of the second half , United looked to be on the offensive substituting Argentinian Carlos Tévez for the Brazilian Anderson and the Red Devils looked to have gained a boost for the first ten minutes of the half , but again Barcelona settled into a passing rhythm United could not break .
In the 53rd minute , Xavi Hernández 's free kick hit the crossbar , which proved to be Barca 's best chance early in the half .
Halfway into the second half , Dimitar Berbatov came on for Ji-Sung Park , but Berbatov proved no better and in the 70th minute Lionel Messi headed in a cross from Hernández , giving Barca an insurance goal .
Four minutes later , Barca captain Carles Puyol has a great chance on goal , but van der Saar in the United goal is equal to the task .
In the next minute , United manager Sir Alex Ferguson , makes his third and final change , subbing in Paul Scholes for Ryan Giggs .
Scholes scored the lone goal in last season 's semi-final to put United into the final , but could not do so and as the minutes ticked off , United got increasingly desperate , earning three yellow cards in the final 12 minutes , but could not score and Barcelona took their second Champions League title since the 2005 -- 06 .
Barcelona also earned two domestic trophies , earning both the La Liga and the Copa del Rey titles .
Manchester United also earned three major trophies , earning the Premier League title , the League Cup title and the Community shield .
In addition United defeated the best international club teams in 2008 Club World Cup .
Both teams will be eligible for the Champions League 2009 -- 10 , with Barcelona as title holders and winners of La Liga and Manchester United as the winners of the Premier League .
Other domestic club champions qualifying for the group state of next season 's competition include Italy 's Internazionale , France 's Bordeaux , Germany 's Wolfsburg , Russia 's Rubin Kazan , Portugal 's Porto , the Netherlands ' Alkmaar Zaanstreek , Scotland 's Rangers , the Ukraine 's Dynamo Kyiv , and Belgium 's Standard Liège .
Champions of Romania and Turkey have yet to be determined and will join the group stage .

June 6 , 2009
French authorities have today revealed that Air France Flight 447 sent 24 error messages shortly before the plane disappeared during the flight between Rio de Janeiro and Paris with 228 people on board .
They also said that the plane 's auto-pilot was not active , although they say that from the error messages it is impossible to determine the reason for it being inactive .
The crash is said to be the world 's worst aviation disaster since 2001 .
Officials have still not determined the reason for the flight 's disappearance or located the wreckage of the plane , but have said that it was flying through an area of `` powerful cumulo-nimbus '' clouds .
The authorities continued saying , `` these are found frequently in this area and in normal climactic -LSB- sic -RSB- conditions '' .
However other meteorologists said the jet was entering a zone with unusual storms and 100mph updrafts which could have formed a vacuum , sucking water up from the ocean .
Fourteen of the error messages sent by the system were done so within a period of one minute , 2:10 a.m. -- 2:11 a.m. UTC .
It is thought that some of the error messages are related to the flight speed and controls related to auto thrust .
Paul-Louis Arslanian , director of the French air accident investigation agency , said that the error messages indicated systems had shut down one after another .
He also confirmed that the plane in question had encountered difficulties with measuring its speed and that Airbus was currently completing `` a programme of replacement , of improvement '' .
Airbus and Arslanian insist that planes are still safe , however Airbus have since re-sent information regarding difficulties with calculating speed and confirming their advice in such situations .
Previous announcements by the Brazilian air force that they had successfully located part of the wreckage of flight 447 have turned out to be false after ships recovered unrelated debris from the sea .
After recovering debris from the sea , including a cargo pallet and two buoys , Brigadier Ramon Cardoso , the director of Brazilian air traffic control said , '' -LSB- U -RSB- p to now , no material from the plane has been recovered . ''
He continued , `` We confirm that the pallet found is not part of the debris of the plane .
It 's a pallet that was in the area , but considered more to be trash .
The pallet was made of wood , and the Air France Airbus A330 did not have any wooden pallets on board .
That 's how we can confirm that the pallet is n't part of the remains of the aircraft '' .
It is thought the pallet came from a passing ship which is also being blamed as to the reason for the oil slick spotted in the area .
David Learmount , operations and safety editor of Flight International magazine , said : `` The fact that the autopilot was not working is not the cause of this accident '' , continuing by saying it is `` not at all unusual '' for the autopilot to cut out , alerting the pilots with a loud warning , adding `` it 's not the cause , it 's the symptom '' of the accident .
He also said that it was `` designed to cut out at any time that it receives conflicting messages , which we know it was '' and that `` It 's designed to cut out rather than controlling the airplane in an unsafe way - it 's not an intelligent system , it does n't know which of the data are correct . ''
Rescuers have long since given up on attempting to find any survivors instead now trying to locate and recover the wreckage of the flight and more importantly the flight data recorders , without which they say they may never know what happened to the flight .
The process of recovery is expected to be difficult with the seabed reaching depths of 3,000 to 4,000 meters .
Both American and French specialist equipment has been sent to the area with the aim of recovering the recorders , however French officials say that the locator beacons attached to the boxes could possibly have become detached by the force of the impact .
Speculation has been rife as to the thought cause of the flights disappearance , ranging from a direct lightning strike to weather in the area , however recently a Spanish pilot has said , via his airline Air Comet , that on a flight in the area he saw an `` intense flash of white light '' .
The report , initially released by the Spanish newspaper El Mundo and then confirmed by AFP also said a co-pilot and passenger also saw the bright light .
`` Suddenly , we saw in the distance a strong and intense flash of white light , which followed a descending and vertical trajectory and which broke up in six seconds '' the unidentified captain said .

June 23 , 2009
Tensions have started to rise again between the United States and North Korea .
North Korea claims that the United States have planned to start an atomic war against them due to President Barack Obama recently reaffirming the nuclear protection of South Korea .
A South Korean Foreign Ministry official on Saturday stated that Seoul has proposed five-way talks with the U.S. , China , Russia and Japan to find a way to deal with the threats given by North Korea .
The United States and Japan agreed to attend the 5-way talks but China and Russia have yet to respond .
Singapore has stated that if the Korean flagship the `` Kang Nam '' is carrying a weapon that is in violation of the United Nations sanctions it would take immediate action .
According to a senior member of the United States military , the `` USS John McCain '' is ready to intercept the `` Kang Nam '' .

filename:<doc id="129242" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=129242" title="North Korean leader Kim Jong-il 'has cancer'"><paragraph:1_3_5_8_9_12_15>:SNT_LIST
July 13 , 2009
The leader of North Korea , Kim Jong-il , is reported to have pancreatic cancer according to YTN , a South Korean news channel .
The unconfirmed reports state that Kim was diagnosed last year , at about the same time of a reported stroke .
YTN broke the news using unidentified sources within South Korea and China .
However , the National Intelligence Service of South Korea could not confirm the illness , while a South Korean Ministry of Unification spokesperson also indicated he had no knowledge of the reported illness .
Kim made a rare public appearance on July 8 of this year to mark the 15th anniversary of his father 's death .
According to reports , Kim was looking `` gaunt '' and walking with a limp .
67-year-old Kim has suffered from several severe health problems in the past few years and speculation about his health has come under doubt several times .
It is reported that Kim Jong-un , Kim Jong-il 's youngest son , is the chosen heir to North Korean leadership , but North Korea has yet to confirm this .
Kim Jong-il took over power in 1994 after his father 's death .
He took over the National Defence Commission of North Korea and as leader of the Workers ' Party of Korea but not the presidency .
Kim 's father , Kim Il-sung , was subsequently named Eternal President of the Republic .
Daniel Pinkston , a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group said that the illness would explain the `` rapidness of some of -LSB- North Korea 's -RSB- actions over the past eight months or so , with the attempted satellite launch , nuclear test and missile tests . ''
Pinkston feels the recent actions are for appearances of normalcy and to shore up internal support for a transition of power to Kim Jong-un .
`` Now they are going through things as if they have a plan or schedule , '' added Pinkston .
Pancreatic cancer is often a life-threatening disease , with the National Cancer Institute estimating a five-year survival rate of 5.5 % .

August 26 , 2009
The United States Office of Management and Budget -LRB- OMB -RRB- is predicting that the national debt of the US will double in 10 years .
Meanwhile , the Congressional Budget Office -LRB- CBO -RRB- has raised its forecast of the 10-year cumulative budget deficit to US$ 7.137 trillion , due to increased spending .
Both offices released reports on Tuesday .
`` Over all , it underscores the dire fiscal situation that we inherited and the need for serious steps to put our nation back on a sustainable fiscal path , '' wrote Peter R. Orszag , President Barack Obama 's budget director .
`` I know that there will be some who say this report proves that we can not afford health reform .
I think that has it backward , '' Orszag said in a conference call .
The CBO report predicts that public debt will exceed 61 % of gross domestic product -LRB- GDP -RRB- by the end of 2010 while continuing to rise to 68 % of GDP by the end of 2019 .
`` If anyone had any doubts that this burden on future generations is unsustainable , they 're gone , '' said Senator Mitch McConnell , the Senate minority leader .
`` Today 's budget numbers send a clear signal that the time for putting off tough choices is over and the time to act is now , '' said the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee , Kent Conrad .
`` While the U.S. health care system does need to be reformed , we can not ignore the fiscal realities of our situation , '' said Senator Judd Gregg who is also on the Senate Budget Committee .
`` We must proceed with extreme caution before putting in place a huge and costly new program that will threaten our economy and the future of our children . ''
`` The administration has always said that you have to get deficits under 3 percent of GDP to be safe .
They now admit that they will not in the next 10 years , '' commented Douglas Holtz-Eakin , a former director of the CBO .
`` I 'm stunned at how hard they have worked to bury this . ''

September 3 , 2009
Two CH-47 Chinook helicopters were called in on Wednesday , September 2nd , to help contain the wildfires on the Hawaiian Island of Molokai .
Smaller helicopters that were fighting the fire since it started around noon on August 29th were redeployed as well .
According to Gen Iinuma , Maui County Civil Defense administrator , the CH-47s carry 2000-gallon buckets of water , whereas the smaller helicopters only have 100-gallon buckets .
The Chinooks can dump more water in fewer trips than the smaller helicopters .
On the other hand , the tremendous downdraft from the bigger aircraft may make the fire worse .
`` If they do n't do it right , they 'll fan the fire , '' Iinuma said .
According to Iinuma , ground crews are continuing to maintain the fire 's perimeter , which remained unchanged from Tuesday .
The helicopters are being used to fight the fires where ground crews ca n't reach , such as steep mountain passes and valleys .
Iinuma also expressed concern about a red flag advisory the National Weather service put out for all leeward areas of the Hawaiian Islands , meaning conditions are ripe for fires .
Lieutenant Governor James `` Duke '' Aiona , who took an aerial survey of Molokai 's brush fire area , said it was `` no immediate threat '' .
He also noted that the fire seemed to come right up to the perimeter of some properties , but almost always stopped there .
Aiona 's observations are mirrored by a local business owners ' story .
The wildfires destroyed the beehives of Molokai Meli , a family-owned honey business in Kapaakea , but residents admit that the beehives were not their main concern .
`` We were just beating the edges with wet towels and sheets to try and keep it from getting to the houses that are just right over that ridge , '' said co-owner Brenda Kaneshiro .
Luckily , the property was spared , though the beehives were n't .
`` All that metal right there , that 's where they all were , there were 33 of them , '' said Elijah Kaneshiro , the owner 's son .

A police investigation is currently taking place in the area and a man in his 30s living in the area has since been arrested on suspicion of arson with intent .
North Yorkshire Police are going to interview the man and try and establish whether he was involved or not .
Kyne was due to ride at Haydock on Saturday afternoon , while Wilson was due to ride at Thirsk on the same day , while riding her mother 's horse , `` Imperial Sword '' -- and so both were staying in the apartment as a means of accommodation , as Jamie came from Ireland and Jan was from Forfar , Scotland .
`` The family are devastated and Jamie was a star , '' Kyne 's aunt said .
`` They -LSB- his parents -RSB- are so proud of him .
At the moment they are just devastated and shocked . ''
David Barron , Wilson 's trainer , paid tribute to her as `` a tremendous jockey '' .
He said : `` She was just at the start of her career and was only in her first year of riding as an apprentice .
She joined me at the end of last year and had ridden three winners for me out of only a handful of rides .
She was very good , very capable and had tremendous potential .
Everyone in the yard is just devastated . ''

September 6 , 2009
At least nine people have died after a ferry with over 960 passengers on board sank off the southeast coast of the Philippines on Sunday .
Thirty more are still unaccounted for .
According to coast guards , 931 people were rescued from the SuperFerry 9 , which had departed from General Santos City and was headed for the peninsula of Zamboanga .
The vessel began to list at 02.30 local time -LRB- 18.30 UTC -RRB- , and issued a distress call an hour later .
The captain reportedly tried to correct the list , but ordered the ship 's rafts to be released when it became clear it was impossible to get the vessel straightened back out again .
The cause of the incident is not yet certain .
Maritime accidents occur frequently in the Philippines , mainly due to poor maintenance of ships , relaxed safety enforcement , overcrowding of ships , and inclement weather .
Last year , 802 passengers including crew were killed when the MV Princess of the Stars ferry sank during a typhoon .

September 13 , 2009
A fire at a drug treatment hospital near Almaty , Kazakhstan , killed it least 38 people on Saturday , authorities have said .
Ten more people have been hospitalised , two of them in critical condition .
The blaze started at approximately 05.30 local time -LRB- 23.30 UTC -RRB- in Taldykorgan .
The fire spread quickly , consuming almost 650 square metres of land .
`` According to tentative data , 38 people were killed , of which 36 were patients and two were medical personnel , '' the national emergency situation ministry stated .
The ministry says that emergency crews managed to rescue up to forty people and medical personnel from the burning building .
Emergency Situations Minister Vladimir Bozhko said that the inhabitants of the building may have been hampered in their escape by locked doors and barred windows .
There was apparently no fire alarm on the premises , and firefighters had not been alerted to the fire quickly enough to contain it .
In a statement on the Internet , Kazakh prime minister Karim Masimov called for a commission to investigate the cause of the fire : `` The country 's prime minister has entrusted the commission with carefully investigating the cause of this tragedy , and taking exhaustive measures to render assistance to the victims .

September 21 , 2009
Local officials have said that an earthquake , measuring 6.1 on the Richter scale , has struck Bhutan , killing at least ten people and damaging many buildings .
The US Geological Survey said that the epicentre of the tremor was located along the country 's southern border with India , 180 kilometres -LRB- 110 miles -RRB- east of Bhutan 's capital Thimphu .
Bhutanese director of disaster management Ugyen Tenzing said that rescue teams were searching the rubble of collapsed buildings for survivors .

There is still information coming in . ''
`` We are anticipating that most of the houses are now down , destroyed , '' said Bhutan Home Minister Minjur Dorji .
He also added that `` these are not like you see in the metropolitan cities , like concrete houses .
These are made of wood , mud and stone , generally two-storied houses . ''
The local governor , Lungthen Dorji , said , `` houses , and monasteries and roads have been damaged .
Mobile services are clogged . ''

filename:<doc id="139668" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=139668" title="Prosecutors begin NY State Sen. Hiram Monserrate felony assault case"><paragraph:1_2_5_11_20_27_29_34_35>:SNT_LIST
September 22 , 2009
At the opening of the criminal trial against New York State Senator Hiram Monserrate on Monday on charges of felony assault , prosecutors explained the motive behind his alleged attack on his girlfriend Karla Giraldo .
During opening arguments in the case , prosecutor Scott Kessler stated that when Monserrate discovered that his girlfriend had the business card of another man , he chose to strike out at her .
According to prosecutor Kessler , Monserrate `` struck her in a jealous rage '' .
Monserrate has entered a plea of not guilty to charges he sliced his girlfriend 's face with broken glass during a conflict at their apartment in December 2008 .
According to the account given in court by prosecutors , Giraldo asked her boyfriend Monserrate for a glass of water .
Prosecutors said that in response , Monserrate stated `` You want the water ?
You want the water ?
Here 's your water ! ''
-- and proceeded to cut her face using the glass .
At the hospital , Giraldo reportedly told healthcare workers : `` I ca n't believe he did this to me .
My face !
My face ! ''
.
The defense team denied that the injury to the woman by Monserrate was intentional , instead claiming that the incident was `` an accident '' .
Monserrate 's lawyer , Joseph Tacopina , said `` What happened was an accident .
There were only two people behind those closed doors and they both say it was an accident .
You wonder why they even brought this case .
It 's nothing more than rank speculation . ''
In Tacopina 's account of the incident , Monserrate was bringing his girlfriend a glass of water and tripped -- and Giraldo woke up and the glass collided into her face .
Tacopina characterized her injuries as `` a freak accident '' .
Kessler asserted that the incident was not an accident on the part of Monserrate .
Referring to Monserrate 's emotions at the time of the incident , Kessler said `` This case is about power and control .
He did n't just want that card thrown out , he wanted it destroyed . ''
According to prosecutors in the case , Giraldo originally stated to law enforcement officials that she had been attacked , and said to a nurse at the hospital where she was treated that her boyfriend had cut her face .
The injuries to Giraldo 's face necessitated 20 stitches in the area surrounding her left eye .
After Giraldo found out that Monserrate would be arrested in the matter , she recanted her statements .
Supreme Court Justice William Erlbaum will judge the case without a jury , as Monserrate waived his right for a trial before his peers .
If convicted , Democrat Sen. Monserrate could serve prison time and lose his New York State Senate seat .
The group National Organization for Women has requested that the judge rule Monserrate should be given `` the maximum sentence allowable by law '' .
In an email to supporters , the organization said : `` Call or write the Honorable William M. Erlbaum .
Send a message that violence against women must be stopped and perpetrators must be brought to justice . ''
Included was a form letter with the message : `` I implore you to do the right thing by punishing Senator Monserrate , giving him the maximum sentence allowable by law .
By doing so , you will be sending a very important message and that is that violence against women is a serious crime . ''
In response to complaints from Monserrate 's attorney that the group 's actions were inappropriate , the president of the organization in New York Marcia Pappas said `` We 're imploring him to do the right thing .
I 'm sure the judge knows what he needs to do , so his position is not compromised . ''
Monserrate is a former city councilman .
He became a member of the New York State Senate weeks after the conflict with Giraldo , and was made chair of the committee overseeing consumer affairs .
Along with Democrat Pedro Espada Jr. , Monserrate started a shift in control of the Senate by aligning with the Republican Party .

filename:<doc id="140446" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=140446" title="Plaintiffs and Amazon propose settlement to Kindle deletion lawsuit"><paragraph:1_7_12>:SNT_LIST
October 2 , 2009
Parties to a lawsuit against Amazon.com agreed September 25 to a proposed settlement resolving claims that Amazon unlawfully deleted content from users ' Kindle reading devices .
Justin Gawronski , a Michigan high school senior , and Antoine Bruguier , a California engineer , had sued on July 30 , after Amazon deleted George Orwell 's `` Nineteen Eighty-Four '' from their Kindles .
Gawronski also said his digital notes lost value because they were no longer associated with the relevant text .
The plaintiffs argued that Amazon had breached its terms of service and violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and Washington Consumer Protection Act .
Amazon had first claimed it was forced to delete the books when it learned it did not have the right to sell them .
However , it apologized on July 23 and on September 7 offered affected customers either US$ 30 or a copy of the deleted book .
The proposed settlement includes a commitment that Amazon will only delete e-books remotely under four circumstances : the user consents , the user fails to pay or gets a refund , the government mandates it , or the deletion is necessary to `` protect '' the consumer , device , or network .
Amazon would also pay KamberEdelson , the plaintiffs ' firm , US$ 150,000 in legal fees , with the proviso that it go to charity .
Michael Aschenbrener , an attorney at KamberEdelson , described the agreement as a `` great settlement '' that `` provides protection for Kindle users and provides confidence to them that the books , newspapers and magazines they purchase will not be subject to remote deletion by Amazon .
It sends a message to digital media purveyors of all kinds that sellers really need to respect users ' rights to that content . ''
Amazon spokesman Drew Herdener refused to comment .
The agreement is still subject to court approval .

October 20 , 2009
Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe led a cabinet meeting on Tuesday without the presence of unity partner Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai , who was out of the country on a regional tour to appeal for help with mediation .
This comes after Tsvangirai and his Movement for Democratic Change -LRB- MDC -RRB- party pulled out of the unity government several days ago , protesting what they called `` dishonest and unreliable '' behaviour by Mugabe .
Zimbabwe state media reported on Tuesday that President Mugabe will not recognise Tsvangirai 's suspension of ties with the government until he is formally informed .
The state-owned daily newspaper , The Herald , quoted Mugabe 's spokesman , George Charamba , as saying Tsvangirai is still prime minister and is expected to attend cabinet meetings .
`` Government is not run through media statements .
In the same way that President Mugabe formally appointed him to the post of Prime Minister he must also communicate any decision to disengage or whatever it is they are calling it , in a formal manner , '' Charamba said .
`` This can be done orally or in writing but in a formal manner .
From that point of view nothing has happened .
Until the communication is done formally the president has no reason or any grounds to think or know otherwise , '' he said .
Tsvangirai , who `` disengaged '' from the country 's unity government last week , was accused by the newspaper of traveling without cabinet approval .
The leader of the MDC party is on a ten-day trip of Southern African Development Community countries , who helped to negotiate the troubled power sharing agreement in Zimbabwe .
Tsvangirai is not due to return to Zimbabwe until sometime next week .
According to The Herald , government officials said that Tsvangirai had attempted to obtain cabinet authority for his trip while en route to the airport , but was told that it was too late to receive it .
However , University of Zimbabwe political science professor John Makumbe said he believed Tsvangirai 's partial withdrawal from the national unity government was long overdue and ZANU-PF 's reaction is mere posturing .
`` Morgan Tsvangirai has done the right thing , he must light fires and make ZANU-PF run around putting the fires out .
What he has been doing to date is agreeing to be treated like a tea-boy , he has been told what to do and he has done it without asking questions , '' Makumbe said .
He said that Mugabe 's ZANU-PF party could n't risk going it alone , as Tsvangirai has a stronger claim to legitimacy as his party won the elections in March 2008 .
Ministers from a splinter faction of the MDC led by Arthur Mutambara attended the cabinet meeting .
Mutambara , who is one of two deputy prime ministers , said at a news conference on Monday that he was talking to both Mugabe and Tsvangirai .
He said the national unity government is Zimbabwe 's only hope of moving forward .
`` We are determined to give this government a fighting chance because in our mind there is no plan B , '' Mutambara said .
Tsvangirai announced last week that his party would not withdraw from the unity government altogether , but would boycott the executive branch whose ministries it shares with the ZANU-PF party .
He cited the reluctance of Mugabe to implement matters that had been agreed to in the so-called Global Political Agreement , which brought the national unity government to power .
Among the outstanding issues is the appointment of governors and the alleged harassment of his party members and Members of Parliament .
His announcement came two days after agriculture deputy minister designate Roy Bennett was arrested and re-detained on charges of insurgency and terror .
Bennett has since been released on bail , but Tsvangirai has said his party will not participate in government until all the issues he raised have been resolved .

filename:<doc id="144397" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=144397" title="UN criticises Israel's latest settlement plan, angry reaction from US and UK"><paragraph:1_2_3_7_8_10_13_18>:SNT_LIST
November 19 , 2009
United States and United Kingdom spokespeople have added to criticism from United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon that Israel 's decision to authorise a further 900 homes in east Jerusalem will `` undermine efforts for peace and cast doubt on the viability of the two-state solution '' .
A spokesperson for Ban Ki-moon stated , `` The Secretary-General deplores the Government of Israel 's decision today to expand Gilo settlement , built on Palestinian territory occupied by Israel in the 1967 war . ''
The US rebuked Israel for their decision .
`` We are dismayed at the Jerusalem planning committee 's decision to move forward on the approval process for the expansion of Gilo in Jerusalem , '' said White House spokesperson Robert Gibbs .
`` At a time when we are working to relaunch negotiations , these actions make it more difficult for our efforts to succeed , '' he said , referring to the attempts by the US to lead the peace process .
`` Neither party should engage in efforts or take actions that could unilaterally pre-empt , or appear to pre-empt , negotiations . ''
US Department of State spokesperson Ian Kelly added , `` We object to this , and we object to other Israeli practices in Jerusalem related to housing , including the continuing pattern of evictions and demolitions of Palestinian homes . ''
The British consulate in Jerusalem issued a statement on behalf of Foreign Secretary David Miliband that read , `` The Foreign Secretary has been very clear that a credible deal involves Jerusalem as a shared capital .
Expanding settlements on occupied land in East Jerusalem makes that deal much harder .
So this decision is wrong and we oppose it . ''
According to Israel Army Radio , Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected a request from the US Middle East envoy George Mitchell on Monday to halt building in the area on the grounds that that Gilo was `` an integral part of Jerusalem '' .
`` Prime Minister Netanyahu -LSB- ... -RSB- is willing to adopt the policy of the greatest possible restraint concerning growth in the West Bank , but this applies to the West Bank , '' said the Prime Minister 's spokesperson Mark Regev .
`` Jerusalem is Israel 's capital and will remain as such . ''
Following the suspension of peace talks last year , the Palestinian National Authority has demanded a halt to all construction of settlements before it will return to negotiations .
President Mahmud Abbas said that the breakdown in talks left him with no choice but to seek international recognition of a Palestinian state unilaterally , despite requests from the United States and the European Union to resume peace talks .
`` We feel we are in a very difficult situation , '' he said in Cairo after talks with his Egyptian counterpart Hosni Mubarak .
`` What is the solution for us ?
To remain suspended like this , not in peace ?
That is why I took this step . ''
This comes as another blow to United States President Barack Obama , whose attempts at brokering a deal to halt settlement expansion are meeting with little success .
With the credibility of the US leader diminishing , French President Nicolas Sarkozy has recently started meeting with a number of Middle East leaders in the past week , attempting to reconcile with Syria and meeting with King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia .

December 21 , 2009
A man has been killed after a car accident in Cornwall , England .
The collision involved a vehicle driving off a quay in Porthleven , near the town of Helston in the county and into the sea at around 2100 Greenwich Mean Time on Friday , according to reports from members of the public made to the police and the coastguard .
A major rescue operation was launched with contributions from the harbourmaster , the ambulance service , the police , the fire crews , a helicopter and the Royal National Lifeboat Institution .
After roughly two hours , a harbour crane lifted the vehicle out of the water that it had crashed into .
It transpired that the man was the only occupant of the vehicle .
It is believed that no other vehicles were involved in the incident .
The man was taken to the Royal Cornwall Hospital , which is situated in Truro , by ambulance .
However , on arrival , he was pronounced dead .
Now tributes are being paid to 20-year-old Jamie Hocking after his death .
The family of the man have said that he will be `` truly missed by all who knew him '' , describing Jamie with the words `` loveable rogue '' .
The family also expressed their thanks to people offering sympathy messages and support from others , as well as the emergency services who assisted at the scene of the accident .

December 21 , 2009
A man has appeared in a court case regarding the murder of a woman from Glasgow , Scotland .
Khalid Mamoun Sarwar , aged 28 , appeared at Glasgow Sheriff Court on charges of theft and murder .
The charges relate to the death of 54-year-old Nasim Jamil .
She was an agony aunt who worked as a presenter on Awaz FM , an Asian community radio station .
She was killed in her apartment on Byres Road in Glasgow .
The radio host 's body was discovered by her daughter on December 9 .
Sarwar , who is from the city , was not making any declarations or pleas during the court trial .
The man was subsequently remanded in custody .
Sources A man has been jailed for the murder of his ex-girlfriend in Lancashire , England , after a trial in Preston Crown Court .
52-year-old Alan Entwistle admitted the murder of his ex-girlfriend and mother of two Claire Atkinson , who came from Elm Street in the town of Fleetwood .
The court heard how he had been planning the murder for several weeks since the relationship between him and Claire had broken down .
A month before the killing he had been charged with kidnap and using a knife to threaten her but was released on bail .
It was said that the former bouncer had been stalking Atkinson on the day of her murder and that he had managed to coax her into his blue Hyundai Getz .
He then stabbed Claire 13 times , with her heart being infiltrated by seven of the wounds from the knife .
After the murder , which occurred on April 17 , 2009 , Alan drove around with the body of the victim in the passenger seat of the car before deliberately crashing the vehicle into the back of a Land Rover .
Alan Entwistle was sentenced to a minimum of 20 years in prison .
Judge Anthony Russell QC described him with the words `` manipulative man '' .
Sources Two people , a man and a woman , have both been killed as the result of car crash in East Yorkshire , England .
The two accident victims have been identified as 20-year-old Rebecca Robinson and 22-year-old Liam Normington .
Both came from Hull .
They were travelling along the A1079 towards Hull in their silver Citroën C2 car when they collided with a silver Volkswagen Passat which was moving in the other direction .
The Citroen slid across the road and the two vehicles collided with each other .
The Citroen then went off the road and rolled down a large embankment , resulting in the vehicle going onto its roof .
The collision occurred at around 1420 GMT on Sunday between the market towns of Beverley and Market Weighton .
Both died at the scene of the accident after sustaining fatal injuries .
The road conditions were icy however Humberside Police have not yet confirmed that this was indeed a factor in the accident .
North Yorkshire Police are now asking for any people who witnessed the collision to contact them .
A spokesperson for the police has said : `` They were in a silver-coloured Citroen C2 , travelling eastbound towards Hull when the car is believed to have veered to the other side of the road causing it to collide with a silver - coloured Volkswagen Passat travelling in the opposite direction .
The Citroen then left the road and went down a very large embankment coming to a rest on its roof .
As a result Liam and Rebecca sustained fatal injuries and sadly died in the incident . ''
Sources A man has died after being found unconscious in the back garden outside his house in Western Isles , Scotland .
35-year-old Donald Martin was found unconscious by one of his neighbours outside his house , located on Kennedy Terrace in Stornoway on the island of Lewis , at around 1300 GMT on Saturday .
He was taken to Western Isles Hospital and placed in a high dependency unit , however the man died later that day .
It is believed that the man froze to death as a result of sub-zero temperatures in the area .
The man was working as an electrician and was not married .
What was to be the last time he was seen was when he was returning to his house from a night out in the town centre of Stornoway , it is understood .
A spokesperson for the Northern Constabulary , the police service in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland , has released a statement saying : `` Despite their best efforts the man was pronounced dead some hours later .
A post mortem will be carried out to establish cause of death and a report will be submitted to the Procurator Fiscal .
There do not appear to be any suspicious circumstances . ''

January 9 , 2010
United Parcel Service -LRB- UPS -RRB- , the world 's largest package delivery service , has announced that it will cut 1,800 administrative and managerial jobs .

The company currently has 340,000 people in its employ .
Economic analysts are paying considerable attention to the financial status of UPS , as many see a large connection between the overall state of the US economy and the amount of parcels shipped .
`` They 're not cutting sales jobs , they 're cutting back office jobs .
They take out back office , they take out cost , '' commented Helane Becker , an analyst for Jesup & Lamont Securities .

January 10 , 2010
Chinese officials have said that their country 's exports surged last December to edge out Germany as the world 's biggest exporter .
The official Xinhua news agency reported today that figures from the General Administration for Customs showed that exports jumped 17.7 % in December from a year earlier .
Over the whole of 2009 total Chinese exports reached US$ 1.2 trillion , above Germany 's forecast $ 1.17 trillion .
Huang Guohua , a statistics official with the customs administration , said the December exports rebound was an important turning point for China 's export sector .
He commented that the jump was an indication that exporters have emerged from their downslide .
`` We can say that China 's export enterprises have completely emerged from their all-time low in exports , '' he said .
However , although China overtook Germany in exports , China 's total foreign trade -- both exports and imports -- fell 13.9 % last year .

January 14 , 2010
A drone attack , suspected to have been made by US forces , killed at least twelve people and injured a further fourteen in northwestern Pakistan earlier today , although some reports put the death toll as high as eighteen .
The attack hit a militant training camp on the border between Pakistan 's North and South Waziristan tribal region .
Pakistani officials , speaking on condition of anonymity , said they believe the target was Pakistani Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud ; however , it was not immediately clear whether Mehsud was killed .
`` We had information that he -LSB- Mehsud -RSB- was around there .
We 're checking on whether he was killed , '' said an unnamed official .
A spokesman for the Taliban , however , told Pakistan 's Dawn TV that Mehsud had left a few minutes before the strike , and was still alive and safe .
It is , however , difficult to verify such claims , as the area is largely autonomous and believed to be a sanctuary for al-Qaeda and Taliban members .
Suspected US missile strikes in Pakistan 's northwest have killed several rebel leaders , including the previous head of the Pakistani Taliban , Baitullah Mehsud , in mid-2009 .

January 25 , 2010
Authorities have said that 48 whales near Christchurch , New Zealand were beached yesterday .
Fifteen of them died , although the other 33 were re-floated out to sea , according to a conservation official .
The pilot whales beached themselves at Port Levy on South Island , but dozens of volunteers helped to try and get them back out to the open water out of the inlet , which is muddy and shallow .
An alarm was called out at about 06.30 local time .
This is the third mass stranding on the country 's coast this summer ; 125 pilot whales died in the two other beachings earlier , and another 43 were re-floated out to the ocean .
`` It 's a very , very shallow bay in Port Levy , very muddy , so whether they were chasing food and got caught in the shallows , we do n't know , '' remarked department community relations manager Grant Campbell to the Associated Press .
`` We thought everything was OK , we checked them in the boat and then we woke up this morning and saw a whole lot on the beach here . ''
Campbell also commented that the whales were up to five metres -LRB- seventeen feet -RRB- long , and some of the calves were between a metre and a metre and a half -LRB- three to five feet -RRB- long .
`` We really just stood with them and as the tide came in and started floating , we were just able to push them out and away they went , '' said a local , Ted Haowden , as quoted by United Press International .
Locals are expected to bury the dead whales this afternoon .
According to Campbell , autopsies will be performed on two of the fifteen dead whales .
Whales are frequently stranded on the beaches of New Zealand each summer , as they travel en route from Antarctica to breeding grounds .
Scientists do n't know why the whales become stranded .

March 4 , 2010
Three suicide bombers in the Iraqi city of Baquba , the capital of the Diyala Governorate , killed at least 29 people earlier today , according to reports , although the Associated Press puts the number at 32 .
According to Captain Ghalib al-Karkhi , the explosions targeted the provincial headquarters , a hospital , and the Iraqi army .
One of the explosions occurred at the headquarters of police , the second near a police checkpoint ; a third bomb blew up at the Baquba general hospital .
A fourth bomb was later detonated by officials without incident about two hundred metres away from the hospital .
Fakhri al-Obaidi , thespokesman of the Diyala provincial council in Baquba , commented on the incidents .
`` These attacks aim to terrify people from going to polling stations .
But I am sure that people will insist on voting , '' as quoted by the Associated Press .
Mahmoud Fadil , aged 50 , was a witness to one of the bombings .
`` I saw others covered with blood lying on the ground and some crying because of wounds caused by shrapnel and the huge blast , '' he said , noting that the blast was strong enough to lift him up into the air .
The attacks come several days before Iraqi parliamentary elections are due on March 7 .
The explosions were the deadliest bombings in the country since February 1 , when a suicide bomber in Baghdad killed 54 people .

March 7 , 2010
At least 24 people died today in Baghdad as dozens of mortars were fired throughout the city , destroying at least two buildings .
The incidents occurred just as Iraq 's parliamentary election commenced .
The election is the second since Saddam Hussein was overthrown in 2003 .
6,200 candidates are competing for 325 parliament seats in the election .
Insurgents have promised to disrupt the elections by means of violence to show their opposition to America and the Shiite-led Iraqi government .
A group linked to al-Qaeda distributed leaflets in the capital advising people against going to vote .
Polling opened at 7 AM -LRB- local time -RRB- and immediately bombs were detonated and mortar rounds landed throughout the city .
In Shurta , West Baghdad , twelve were confirmed dead , and rescue workers saved twenty from the debris of a demolished building .
Across the Tigris River , in East Baghdad , five were killed in a blast at a residential building .
The Green Zone , the area that hosts the U.S. Embassy and the Prime Minister 's office , was also hit by mortar rounds .
Seven others died in various parts of the nation .
No polling stations were hit .
Nouri Maliki , the present Prime Minister , called for a strong turnout to boost democracy in the country .
Although violence in Iraq is much reduced from its peak , hundreds of people are dying each month even now and the country continues to have poor infrastructure .
To prevent attacks , the border with Iran was shut down , several troops deployed , and movement of unauthorized vehicles banned , leaving Baghdad 's roads almost empty .
Despite this , people continued to head to the polls .
`` If we had to crawl , we would crawl in order to vote , '' said a resident , Ali Abdul Wahab , though according to him : `` anyone we vote for will be bad . ''
On Saturday , a car bomb detonated near a parking lot used by pilgrims in the Shiite holy city of Najaf , killed three .
Two Iranians and an Iraqi were those who died in the attack , only about 300 yards from the Imam Ali shrine , a holy site in Shiite Islam .
54 people were wounded , of whom 19 were Iranians .

March 30 , 2010
A Cook County , Illinois Circuit Court judge has lifted a temporary restraining order on a law that requires a girl 's parents to be notified before she has an abortion .
In a complicated ruling , however , the judge also issued an order banning state officials from enforcing the law pending an appeal .
The law , which was passed by the Illinois legislature in 1995 , has never been enforced due to appeals .
Last November , the Illinois medical disciplinary board allowed the law to be enforced , but hours later Judge Daniel A. Riley granted a temporary restraining order filed by the American Civil Liberties Union -LRB- ACLU -RRB- of Illinois .
When Judge Riley issued another ruling yesterday , he said the ACLU lawsuit was flawed , finding the law itself to be constitutional .
He added , however , that `` the law in question is a rather unfortunate piece of legislation '' that is inherently discriminatory against pregnant minors .
ACLU lawyers plan to file an appeal , which Judge Riley will rule on with a new restraining order in place .
They argue that the law is an invasion of privacy and dangerous to minors who live in an abusive environment .
The Illinois Attorney General 's office is defending the law , saying that parents should be able to give their children advice on complicated matters .

filename:<doc id="170869" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=170869" title="German Physical Society demands nuclear disarmament"><paragraph:1_2_7_10>:SNT_LIST
April 9 , 2010
A German newspaper has recently reported on a declaration of the German Physical Society advocating to start negotiations on a Nuclear weapons convention for the elimination of all nuclear weapons before the year 2020 .
Encompassing more than 58,000 members and all German laureates of the physics Nobel prize of the recent years , the German Physical Society or Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft -LRB- DPG -RRB- represents the largest professional organization of physicists worldwide .
Its recent statement advances the forthcoming review conference on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty -LRB- NPT -RRB- to be held in New York next month .
The declaration points out : `` Indeed , it is with a certain sense of relief we can state that since the mid-1980s , a large proportion of the more than 70,000 nuclear weapons have been reduced .
Yet today 's deployed nuclear weapons are still sufficient to extinguish modern civilization .
In addition , nothing has changed about the fundamental inhumanity of nuclear armaments , because their use would affect military targets as well as civilian populations indiscriminately , and thus would be generally contrary to existing international humanitarian law , based on the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice . ''
The physicists are particularly concerned about the proliferation of nuclear weapons , expecting `` that a regional use of nuclear weapons could become more likely if more states or even terror groups obtain access to weapons-grade fissile material '' .
Having a closer look to the continued work of weapon laboratories of the nuclear powers , they state : `` We can not accept that nuclear weapons continue to be developed today . ''
Strengthening the non-proliferation requires the `` nuclear powers to meet their responsibility for complete implementation of the Non-Proliferation Treaty '' , who pledged in its Article VI `` to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament '' .
The DPG addresses in its statement the perspective of a nuclear weapon free world as outlined by US president Barack Obama in his Prague 's speech last year and that has been supported by Russia 's president , Dmitry Medvedev .
Probably , the chances for the physicists have never been better before to achieve a complete abolition of nuclear weapons as it has been negotiated upon in the case of biological und chemical weapons .
The continued development of such weapons of mass destruction appears to DPG and its members as `` inconsistent with the ethical principles to which we as scientists are committed . ''

April 17 , 2010
Several tobacco manufacturers and retailers in the United Kingdom have been fined a total of £ 225 million for price fixing .
The fines were imposed by the Office of Fair Trading -LRB- OFT -RRB- following an investigation lasting seven years .
It is the largest penalty ever issued by the OFT for breaches of the 1998 Competition Act , with the case involving two major tobacco makers and numerous British supermarkets .
Together the manufacturers involved , Imperial Tobacco -LRB- whose brands include Golden Virginia and Lambert & Butler -RRB- and Gallaher Group -LRB- who own Silk Cut and Benson & Hedges among others -RRB- make almost 90 % of all cigarettes and roll-ups sold in the UK .
They were fined £ 112 million and £ 50 million respectively .
The supermarkets facing the largest penalties were Asda and The Co-operative Group , at £ 14 million each .
Other stores fined were First Quench , Morrisons , Safeway , Shell garages , Somerfield , T&S Stores -LRB- now One Stop -RRB- and TM Retail .
Also taking part in the price fixing were Sainsbury 's , though they received immunity from being fined after alerting the OFT and co-operating with the investigation .
Some of the other companies also earned reductions in their fines through co-operation with the OFT .
Similar allegations against Tesco were not pursued due to a lack of evidence .
Imperial Tobacco denied the charges , claiming in a statement that its dealings with the retailers were simply legitimate `` promotional arrangements '' .
They have said they are considering an appeal against the decision .
In a press release the OFT said that the fines would send out a strong message .
`` Practices such as these , which restrict the ability of retailers to set their resale prices for competing brands independently , are unlawful . ''
said Simon Williams , OFT Senior Director of Goods .
`` They can lead to reduced competition and ultimately disadvantage consumers . ''
`` This enforcement action will send out a strong message that such practices , which could in principle be applied to the sale of many different products , can result in substantial penalties for those who engage in them . ''

April 24 , 2010
Eleven suspected Somali pirates have been indicted in the US in connection with recent attacks on two US navy ships off the coast of Africa .
The men were brought to a courthouse in Virginia on Friday , to face piracy charges after being detained on US ships as the cases against them were being prepared .
A first group of five suspected pirates was indicted in connection with what authorities say was a firefight on March 31st between the `` USS Nicholas '' and their vessel in the Indian Ocean .
The six other defendants were charged with an alleged April 10th attack on the `` USS Ashland '' in the Gulf of Aden near Djibouti .
If convicted , they will face life in prison .
Until recently , pirates detained in international operations off the African coast were generally tried in Kenya .
Kenyan authorities , however , recently indicated they needed more international financial help for this ; Voice of America reports that Kenyan courts are becoming overloaded with piracy cases .

May 6 , 2010
The flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder , or `` black boxes '' , from an Air France plane that crashed on June 1 last year in the Atlantic Ocean , have been localized to within about 2 square miles -LRB- 5 square kilometers -RRB- , a French official said on Thursday .
The French government and military officials have urged caution , saying there is no guarantee the flight recorders will be found .
French navy spokesman Hugues du Plessis d'Argentre commented to AFP , '' -LSB- I -RSB- t 's like trying to find a shoe box in an area the size of Paris , at a depth of 3,000 m -LRB- 9,800 ft -RRB- and in a terrain as rugged as the Alps . ''
The aircraft , an Airbus A330-200 , carrying 216 passengers and 12 crew members , for a total of 228 people on board , crashed in the Atlantic Ocean after flying in bad weather .
The pitot tubes , which measure airspeed , are considered likely to have been a contributing factor to the crash .
However , the actual cause has yet to be determined .
The search is now in its third phase , which started on March 30 -- April 1 , 2010 and was originally announced to last 30 days .
However , on May 4 , the search was extended to May 25 .

May 10 , 2010
Reports suggest methane gas was to blame for two explosions in a Russian coal mine which are thought to have left up to twelve miners dead and eighty others unaccounted for .
Local officials say at least 41 miners have been injured .
The explosions come after calls for coal mines in Russia to improve their poor safety records .
Over three hundred miners were underground when the first explosion occurred just prior to midnight on Saturday night and most of them were brought safely to the surface .
However , officials report that eleven miners died in the first explosion .
Around three hours later a second explosion occurred and authorities on the surface lost contact with a rescue team below .
Following the second explosion , an emergency services ministry spokeswoman told the media that rescue operations had been suspended indefinitely .
Aman Tuleyev , the governor of Siberia 's western Kemerovo region , has taken charge of the rescue operation .
Tuleyev said the second blast had caused more injuries and destroyed the main air shaft .
He also stated that there was a risk of more explosions .
`` The rescue work will continue when the atmosphere in the mine is restored , but to conduct rescue work now means to send people to their death , '' he said .
Reports suggest emergency workers are attempting to pump breathable air into the mine .
The mine , owned by Russian company Raspadskaya , is the largest underground coal mine in Russia .
A worker was killed after part of the mine collapsed in January 2010 .

May 14 , 2010
At least 21 miners in China are dead after an explosion at a coal mine in the southwestern Guizhou province earlier today , according to reports .
The incident occurred at the Yuanyang mines in the city of Anshun .
According to the Chinese news agency Xinhua , there were ten other workers in the mine who were rescued .
It was not immediately clear what caused the explosion , although it is being investigated , Xinhua reports .
The colliery is operated by the government of the local township .
A rescue worker present at the scene says five of the survivors were hospitalised due to carbon monoxide inhalation .
`` We arrived at the mine to carry out the rescue at midnight , and helped bring three of the survivors out of the shaft , '' he told Xinhua .
Despite an initiative to increase the safety of collieries , Chinese mines are among the most dangerous in the world ; official statistics say 2,631 workers died in 1,616 separate incidents last year , although the figure is down 18 % from 2008 .

May 16 , 2010
Hong Kong 's by-elections , triggered by the resignation of five legislators , Wong Yuk-man , Tanya Chan , Leung Kwok-hung , Albert Chan , and Alan Leong , will take place today .
The five legislators left the Legislative Council earlier this year in protest of the government 's indifference towards universal suffrage and the abolishment of functional constituencies .
The elections started at 07.30 local time -LRB- 23.30 UTC -RRB- today , and are due to end at ten o'clock tonight .
Results are expected to be released tomorrow morning .
Chief Executive Donald Tsang has decided not to vote .
Financial Secretary John Tsang , who was in Shanghai , stated that `` Donald Tsang will expound on his opinions '' .
Prominent politicians Leung Chun Ying and Anthony Cheung also refused to vote .
The heads of the DAB and Liberal Party did n't cast their ballots either , the former going on a trip to avoid voting .
Their abstention provoked the criticism of several pan-democrats , including Audrey Eu .
As of 18.00 today -LRB- 10.00 UTC -RRB- , 405880 voters have voted .
The percentage of registered voters who voted is 12.03 % ; The highest is Kowloon West , with 14.9 % , while New Territories West was the lowest , at 9.93 % .
Some members of the Pro-Beijing camp have also decided to vote for Pamela Pak , a Hong Kong radio celebrity .
Wong Yuk-man says he does not mind , for even a vote for his major opponent means a rise in the number of voters .

May 26 , 2010
A Cirrus SR-20 aircraft crashed into an office building in Markham , a town near Toronto , at 12:30 p.m. local time yesterday .
Both people on board were killed .
The aircraft , which crashed into the roof of the two-storey building at Woodbine and Hooper streets , was engulfed in flames .
Witnesses say that it looked as if the pilot was trying to find somewhere to land and that the aircraft was trailing smoke and rolled before it crashed .
First reports state that the pilot and passenger were killed on impact , and the 14 employees at Thinkway Toys manufacturing all escaped the two-storey building and explosions from the crash .
The crash site is near Buttonville airport where many amateur and flight training flights occur .

June 30 , 2010
US airlines in the first quarter of 2010 managed to eke out a US$ 12 million profit , mostly from `` ancillary '' services like checked baggage fees , pet transportation fees and more .
Compared to the first quarter of 2009 , checked baggage fees soared 33 % to $ 769 million .
The airlines also reaped $ 554 million in reservation change fees , and made $ 534 million from other ancillary sources ; such services -LRB- including checked baggage fees , reservation change fees , etc. -RRB- made up 21.7 % of Spirit Airlines ' income , the highest in the industry .
The US airline industry is made up of 21 carriers , according to the U.S Department of Transportation .
The five `` network '' or legacy carriers -- including United Airlines , Delta Air Lines , Continental Airlines , American Airlines and US Airways -- continue to struggle and posted a $ 163 million loss as a group .
Delta Air Lines had the highest profit , at $ 107 million , while American Airlines was at the other side of the carriers , with a $ 322 million loss .
Low-cost carriers fared better , posting a $ 115 million profit as a group , with Southwest Airlines having the largest profit , at $ 54 million , while Allegiant Air 's profit margins were the highest of the budget carriers at 20 % .
Regional airlines made a $ 60 million profit .
The world 's airlines expect a US$ 2.5 billion profit as a whole , despite an earlier forcast of a loss .
However , many investors and groups , such as the International Air Transport Association -LRB- IATA -RRB- , are somewhat doubtful of this number , as oil prices are expected to remain volatile , leading to the possibility of high prices cutting into airlines ' profits .

filename:<doc id="195200" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=195200" title="Six H1N1 cases appear in the Philippines"><paragraph:1_3_7_9>:SNT_LIST
July 13 , 2010
Six students in Ilocos Sur , Philippines tested positive for the H1N1 influenza virus .
This occurrence is part of a rise in A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- and malaria during recent weeks in two provinces , as was the confirmation of twenty cases of malaria in Zambales .
Officials from the Department of Health say that they are not surprised , as A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- cases began to appear at about the same time last year , coinciding with the onset of the local flu season .
Other health officials believe that the rise is due to the onset of the rainy season .
The department noted that all prior cases in the Philippines have been `` mild '' and patients fully recovered .
In the current case , five of those affected have recovered , while one still shows slight symptoms .
`` If we look at the pattern for this month , it was also the same time last year when cases of A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- started increasing , '' says Dr. Lyndon Lee Suy , `` As it is , it is flu season already . ''
The Department of Health believes that the appearance of the virus should not cause distress ; however , Suy warns that a new strain could appear .
The Philippines reported their first case of A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- in May 2009 in a ten-year-old child from the United States .
According to the World Health Organization , 214 countries and territories have confirmed cases of A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- , with a total of more than 18,311 deaths .
As of June 2009 , around 129 cases have been reported in the Philippines .

filename:<doc id="195651" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=195651" title="Scholastic sued for Harry Potter copyright infringement"><paragraph:1_5_9>:SNT_LIST
July 15 , 2010
A trustee of the estate of the late author Adrian Jacobs filed a lawsuit against the US publisher of the Harry Potter series , Scholastic Inc , on Tuesday .
He claimed that J. K. Rowling , the author of the Harry Potter series , had copied scenes from Jacob 's novel , The Adventures of Willy the Wizard , to the fourth novel of the series , Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire .
The suit followed a similar case last year , in which the trustee sued the UK publisher of the series , Bloomsbury Publishing plc. .
Both of these cases are currently pending .
The complaint stated that in both books , the protagonists `` are required to deduce the exact nature of the central task in the competition '' , and had done so in a bathroom .
Both books also involved `` rescuing hostages imprisoned by a community of half-human , half-animal creatures . ''
The suit also claimed that Christopher Little , a literary agent of Rowling , was originally the literary agent of Jacobs .
The claim was denied by Scholastic .
Scholastic called the claim `` completely without merit '' .
They pointed out that Rowling had said in February that she had never read Jacobs ' book .
The trustee said that the US was the world 's largest foreign market , so they brought their first overseas action there .
He demanded that all copies of the Harry Potter novel be destroyed , and all the profit made by the book given to him .

filename:<doc id="196468" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=196468" title="Coalition ups ante on Australian school tax rebates"><paragraph:1_3_5_6_7_8_10>:SNT_LIST
July 21 , 2010
Australian opposition leader Tony Abbott has pledged private school relief if the Liberal/National coalition wins the upcoming federal election .
The pledge came in response to the Australian Labor Party leader , and current Prime Minister , Julia Gillard proposing a uniform and school equipment tax break expansion .
Abbott 's proposal includes an offer of tax rebates for sending a child to a private school .
For students in primary school , prep to grade 6 , the rebate will rise to $ 500 Australian a year per student and families will be then able to claim 50 % rebate up to $ 1000 .
`` We are expanding the rebate so it can be claimed for school fees and also for other educational costs such as tuition and special educational costs for children with , for instance , dyslexia , '' Abbott said at a press conference in Brisbane .
Before the election was called , Gillard had aimed to pledge $ 220 million over four years to expand the current tax breaks to cover refunds each worth $ 390 for primary school uniforms and $ 779 for high school uniforms , as well as refunds for other school equipment like texts books and computers .
`` We all know that uniforms can be an expensive part of sending kids to school , but this change , along with the existing refund for textbooks and computers , will help families with that cost , '' stated Gillard .
An opposition spokesperson claimed that the `` obvious flaw in Labor 's policy is that it only applies to stationery , computer expenses and uniforms -LSB- ... -RSB- You know as a parent that you need help for a whole range of expenses .
Extra teachers for children with dyslexia or the costs of doing music and all the other expenses like excursions and so forth . ''
The expansion is expected to cost $ 760 million in total and one that Abbott claims needs to happen as `` cost of living pressures tend to be greatest when your kids are at school '' .

filename:<doc id="198766" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=198766" title="Revenge killings follow shooting of Karachi politician"><paragraph:1_4_7_9_10_12_13_15_17_21_22>:SNT_LIST
August 7 , 2010
Businesses remained closed for a second day on Wednesday in the Pakistani financial capital of Karachi , to mourn Raza Haider , a leading politician of the Muttahida Quami Movement -LRB- MQM -RRB- , assassinated on Monday .
Nineteen people were killed on Tuesday in revenge killings , bringing the death toll to 49 over two days .
Twenty-five shops and a number of vehicles including trucks and buses were burned in a series of arson attacks across the city .
Haider was gunned down while attending a funeral near the centre of the city .
An officer at the Nazimabad police station said '' -LSB- t -RSB- he number of attackers and the mode of their transport are not clear , but initial investigations suggest that there were more than two people who came on a motorcycle and they were probably backed by armed men in a car .
They first shot at the legislator 's guard Khalid Khan and then entered the mosque and fired at Mr Haider who was in the ablution room . ''
Following the first night of revenge attacks and arson the MQM accused its main political rival , the Awami National Party -LRB- ANP -RRB- , of supporting the Islamist militants suspected of the assassination .
The MQM is a coalition partner with the ANP in the national government and is known as a party that holds great potential for mass mobilization in the province of Sindh .
The Associated Press -LRB- AP -RRB- said that the MQM 's accusation `` appeared to reflect the complex and vicious political and ethnic fault lines that crisscross Karachi . ''
The AP also said that Sharfuddin Memon , the head of the Citizen 's Police Liason Committee had speculated that Haider 's killing may be related to a government operation against `` land mafias '' , who illegally occupy commercially valuable land .
According to the AP 's report it is alleged that some of these mafias have the backing of political parties .
According to human rights organizations there have been more than 300 political killings in Karachi this year .
By Tuesday evening the Jinnah Post Graduate Medical Centre had received 17 dead bodies and 55 injured .
The head of the hospital , Dr Seemi Jamali , said that they had transfused 200 blood units to victims of targeted violence and that 31 gunshot victims had been operated upon that day .
This week 's wave of violence and attacks began with the assassination of Raza Haider , but due to the nature of Karachi politics the exact motive behind Haider 's murder is unclear .
The Associated Press commented that the city has long been plagued by political violence between supporters of rival parties `` that draw votes from different ethnic groups in the city of 16 million people . ''
The publication said this muddied the reasons for the bloodshed .
Rehman Malik , Pakistan 's Interior Minister was quoted by media as saying Islamist militants were likely suspects .
He said that Haider had been on the extremist hit list .
The BBC reported that they had been told by security officials in Karachi that there is evidence to suggest the assassination was carried out by the Lashkar-e-Jhangvi , Pakistan 's deadliest militant group .
The BBC News website also reported that senior MQM leader Babar Ghauri had said : `` Every MQM activist will now be looking to pay back the people involved in this heinous act '' .
Raza Haider was laid to rest on Tuesday at the Martyr 's Graveyard in Azizabad , northern Karachi .
Hundreds of MQM members and supporters attended to pay their final respects to Haider and to his guard Khalid Khan , also killed in the shooting .
The funeral took place under tight security , and with activists raising slogans against the violence that has gripped the city .

August 7 , 2010
Two police officers in Gwent , Wales have been taken off duty after they allegedly smashed the windows of an SUV .
One officer supposedly struck a window with his baton , while the other jumped on the bonnet -LRB- hood -RRB- and kicked the windshield .
The driver , 70-year old Robert Whatley , was stopped for not wearing his seatbelt September 9 , 2009 .
A retired businessman from Usk , Whatley is a stroke victim and takes medication for his heart condition .
He was driving away while he was being issued a fixed penalty notice .
He thought that the police were finished with him , and he needed his medication , he told Caerphilly magistrates court .
He was convicted of motoring offences today at the conclusion of a two-day trial but cleared of failure to stop after an accident .
It had been alleged he struck an officer with his car as he drove away .
Deputy Chief Constable Carmel Napier said `` Gwent Police expects the highest professional standards of its police officers and police staff at all times and we can assure Mr. Whatley and the public that this matter will be thoroughly investigated . ''

August 29 , 2010
A University of Tokyo group of researchers , led by bioengineer Shoji Takeuchi , has made an electronic sensor capable of smelling gases .
The sensor uses genetically engineered frog cells .
Since previous sensors were not very accurate , the scientist decided to try a biological approach .
The invention was revealed in a US scientific journal yesterday , and is supposed to be used to design better machines to detect polluting gases in the atmosphere .
Previous smell sensors were based on quartz rods , which vibrate when a substance binds to them .
The gases are distinguished by their molar masses , which can be similar for molecules with different structure , thus relatively often triggering a false positive .
Trying to find a more accurate solution , Takeuchi decided to follow an example from insect world .
As he explained , `` when you think about the mosquito , it is able to find people because of carbon dioxide from the human .
So the mosquito has CO2 receptors .
When we can -LRB- extract -RRB- DNA -LRB- from the mosquito -RRB- we can put this DNA into the frog eggs to detect CO2 . ''
Genes of several insects -LRB- the silk moth , diamondback moth and fruit fly -RRB- , injected into African clawed frog Xenopus laevis eggs , allowed them to produce relatively inexpensive and useful sensors .
The choice of the species was caused by their widely studied and well-understood protein expression mechanism .
The modified cells responded to three kinds of pheromones and one odourant , which have similar chemical properties .
When a molecule of an odorous substance adhered to the receptor on the membrane protein , ion channels opened for a certain period of time , and a current was generated .
Its magnitude was clearly different for all four tested substances , allowing to distinguish between them accurately .
The colleagues embedded the sensor into a mannequin , so that it could shake its head when a gas was detected .
It was easier to observe .
Pheromones and molecules with quite similar molecule structure produced clearly distinguishable reaction , with higher accuracy than other biological or human-made sensors .
As the research group said , the detection sensitivity of the odor sensor is several tens of parts per billion -LRB- ppb -RRB- , and it is as high as the sensitivity of an existing odor sensor that uses an oxide semiconductor .
The distinctive feature of the new sensor is its capability to selectively detect some odorous substances , rather than its sensitivity .
Very few false positives were possible due to the biological mechanism involved .
At normal temperature , the sensor lifetime is about 12 hours , which can be extended by putting it into a refrigerator before first use .
Shoji Takeuchi says has a great hope for research use in future , since the frog eggs are very practical for genetic engineering , and can be conveniently used to develop smell sensors for a wide range of gases .
He said , `` The X. laevis oocyte has high versatility for the development of chemical sensors for various odorants .
We believe that a shared ability to smell might open a new relationship between man and robot .
.
.
The research will have wide implications ... If the sensor is embedded in a nursing robot , it will be able to identify certain mouth odors or body odors .
Also , it can be used for detecting CO2 , air pollution , water pollution and food .
It 's very important for the environment . ''

August 30 , 2010
Ian Baldwin , of the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology in Jena , Germany , and colleagues have discovered a multi-step protective mechanism of tobacco plants against Manduca sexta caterpillars .
In response to a chemical in the caterpillars ' larvae , the plants release an odorous substance into air to attract another species of insects , called `` big-eyed bugs '' -LRB- Geocoris -RRB- .
These carnivores come to the scene and attack the caterpillars .
The response is triggered within 24 hours , which is a relatively short period of time .
The discovery occurred as a result of field studies in a nature preserve in southwestern Utah .
The phenomenon starts with the recognition of the caterpillars by the plant .
As a PhD student in the Department of Molecular Ecology Silke Allmann explained , `` The plant can not see its attacker , but plants can sense the digestive substances that attacking larvae have in their oral secretions when these substances come into contact with the leaves . ''
To test that , the scientists coated some of caterpillars ' eggs on two groups of tobacco plants and glued them .
On one of the groups , the glue was mixed with caterpillars ' split .
The latter got more attention of the attackers , getting 25 % of eggs destroyed against 8 % for the other group .
Allmann supposed that `` The simplest assumption is that the larval oral secretions contain a special enzyme , probably an isomerase , which rearranges the Z : E ratio of the aldehyde in favor of -LRB- E -RRB- -2-hexenal . ''
The researchers heated the oral secretion to destroy the enzyme , and applied it to wounded leaves .
No plant response related to the studied process was observed , confirming the hypothesis .
-LRB- E -RRB- -2-hexenal is a strong antibiotic agent .
The food consumed by a caterpillar typically includes hundreds of microorganisms together with leaf tissue , which are mostly unneeded and killed by the above-mentioned substance quickly .
Because of this important role of this substance , the caterpillars ca n't change their metabolism easily enough to prevent the subsequent events from happening .
To find out what happens after a caterpillar 's presence is noted by the plant , Silke Allmann , a graduate student in Baldwin 's group , examined the green leafy volatiles -LRB- GLVs -RRB- , the substances responsible for the smell of fresh-cut plant parts .
These substances are released into air if a plant is damaged .
As the study released , the tobacco plant GLVs typically have a major share of Z isomers with very small amount of E isomers present .
But the shares are distributed equally during a caterpillar attack .
In a study with varying amount of different isomers present , E isomers turned out to be the ones attracting the predators to come to the scene and to attack the caterpillars .
What is surprising , Silke Allmann found that the caterpillars are the direct stimulus of this change : caterpillar saliva converts the Z-isomers of the GLV molecules to E-isomers .
Prof. Ian Baldwin commented , `` That 's where it got really weird .
Why would a caterpillar do this to itself ? ''
He suggested that the E-GLVs could have anti-biotic effect in the caterpillar 's digestive system .
The speed of the triggered reaction is relatively fast , it taking about one hour for the GLV isomers ratio change , and about 24 hours for the predators to be attracted by the substance released into the air .
As Prof. Ian Baldwin , who was leading the research , said , `` Other indirect defense mechanisms of plants require the activation of new metabolic pathways for the release of odorant signals , and these responses are much slower . ''
The multi-step intricate approach involved is attracting the attention of scientists , who are looking forward to its application in agriculture .
Baldwin noted that `` in effect , the caterpillar calls the police on itself '' , and suggested to genetically modify crops to release similar signals to defend themselves against pests .

September 3 , 2010
The USGS says an earthquake of magnitude 7.0 occurred in the Canterbury region of New Zealand 's South Island at Saturday 04:35:44 AM local time -LRB- Friday 16:35:44 UTC -RRB- .
Officials in New Zealand say the magnitude was 7.1 .
The earthquake occurred at a depth of 10.0 kilometers -LRB- 6.21 miles -RRB- .
The epicenter was located 40 kilometers -LRB- 25 miles -RRB- west of Christchurch ; 190 kilometers -LRB- 115 miles -RRB- south-southeast of Westport ; 295 kilometers -LRB- 185 miles -RRB- southwest of Wellington ; and 320 kilometers -LRB- 200 miles -RRB- north-northeast of Dunedin .
New Zealand 's Civil Defence Minister John Carter has declared a state of emergency in Christchurch and Selwyn District .
Widespread damage extending beyond Christchurch has damaged infrastructure , including substantial disruption to the power and water supply .
Two people were reported seriously injured , and local residents have also reported that chimneys have fallen in through roofs , ceilings cracked and brick walls collapsed .
Several aftershocks were also felt as far north as New Plymouth .
Bob Parker , the mayor of Christchurch , told the New Zealand Herald that he is `` thankful there has been no loss of life but there had been considerable damage across the city and outlying areas . ''
`` We are very happy and blessed that no one died , '' Prime Minister John Key said ; he further pledged that `` we are here to support them .
We are not going to let Christchurch suffer this great tragedy on their own . ''
People in the Christchurch area have been told not to enter the CBD , and a curfew has been established there from 7 pm to 7 am .
Other towns have also had parts closed off to be inspected for safety .
The NOAA 's evaluation of the situation predicts that significant damage will not progress beyond New Zealand : `` Based on the earthquake magnitude , location and historic tsunami records , a damaging tsunami is not expected along the California , Oregon , Washington , British Columbia , and Alaska coasts .
At coastal locations which have experienced strong ground shaking , local tsunamis are possible due to underwater landslides . ''

September 7 , 2010
ETA -LRB- Euskadi Ta Askatasuna -RRB- , a separatist group based out of the Basque region of northern Spain , announced in a recorded and written message that it would end its armed campaign for independence , instead focusing on political means for achieving its goals .
The Spanish government has rejected the ceasefire .
In the video sent to the BBC , ETA stated that , while the autonomy framework enshrined in the Spanish constitution is `` not the way to satisfy the wishes of the Basque people '' , the organisation was committed to finding a democratic solution to the conflict .
Several analysts have suggested that this most recent ceasefire is based on ETA 's tactics causing their support in the Basque region to plummet .
Author Paddy Woodworth found in a recent trip to the region that the group 's actions had made former supporters of the movement believe ETA was politically finished .
The BBC 's Sarah Rainsford said that ETA is at the weakest point in its 51-year history and that the ceasefire may just be a ploy to disguise that weakness .
The group , which is listed as a terrorist organization by the European Union and the United States , have declared ceasefires several times before , which have all ended in a resumption of violence .
The most recent ceasefire , in 2006 , led to peace talks between the group and the Spanish government , but they were interrupted by a car-bombing at Madrid 's Barajas Airport .
The bombing was frowned upon by all involved in the peace process , including other Basque separatist parties in the region .
On September 6 the Spanish government rejected the ceasefire , saying that the group can not be trusted after the last ceasefire , alleging that the group was calling the ceasefire because they were too weak to stage attacks , and asserting the ceasefire is a way for them to regroup and rearm .
Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba said Monday that the group would have to completely renounce violence for the government to accept the ceasefire .

filename:<doc id="208936" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=208936" title="Genetic link to migraines discovered by researchers"><paragraph:1_3_7_11>:SNT_LIST
September 27 , 2010
New research published in the journal Nature Medicine has shown a link between a faulty gene and migraines .
Scientists hope that this discovery will lead to improved pain management treatments for sufferers , with possible benefits for pain treatment generally .
The breakthrough involves a gene known as TRESK , thought to control the brain 's reaction to pain : if it is defective , then many normal activities and actions will be painful .
Migraine sufferers -LRB- thought in the United Kingdom to number about eight per cent of men and eighteen per cent of women -RRB- often complain that light , noise and touch cause pain .
TRESK can potentially be affected by drugs that would change the point at which it reports pain , which would alleviate the suffering of those with migraines .
Now researchers will need to find such a drug .
The study involved scientists from the Medical Research Council Functional Genomics Unit at the University of Oxford and from Canada .
They looked at the DNA of 110 people with migraine and members of their family , and found that TRESK was a major component in migraines .
One of the Oxford researchers , consultant neurologist Zameel Cader , described it as a `` once in a generation find '' and said that it could `` potentially lead to a treatment for pain in general . ''
Before this study , no genes had been directly linked to migraines , although parts of the DNA that raised the general risk had been found .
Migraines are described by the World Health Organisation as a major worldwide cause of disability .
In Britain , it is estimated that migraines affect 20 per cent of the population , with about 190,000 migraines occurring daily and over 25 million lost days from work every year .
Lee Tomkin , director of a sufferers ' charity , Migraine Action , described the news as `` fantastic '' and `` genuinely a really great step forward . ''
Professor Peter Goadsby from the Migraine Trust termed it `` a novel direction to consider new therapies in this very disabling condition . ''

October 5 , 2010
Tributes are being paid following the announcement late last night that the veteran British actor and comedian Sir Norman Wisdom has died at the age of 95 .
He passed away peacefully at the Abbot 's Wood nursing home , Ballasalla , Isle of Man yesterday evening .
Following a series of strokes over the last 6 months , his health had declined severely .
Sir Norman 's career spanned almost seven decades , during which time he starred in 19 films , and 38 sitcoms , most as the inept character `` Pitkin '' , the persistant thorn in the side of his boss , Mr. Grimsdale .
His most well known serious role came in the television play `` Going Gently '' in 1981 , for ITV , in which he played a patient in hospital suffering from terminal cancer .
Following the news , the Albanian Ambassador in the UK , Zef Mazi explained that Sir Norman 's death was covered on all the news channels in Albania , where he was exceptionally popular .
His material was the only Western-style comedy permitted to be shown in the Communist country .
`` After Charlie Chaplin , he was the biggest comedy star in Albania .
I still remember his character Pitkin and his boss Mr Grimsdale , '' he said .
`` He was very popular with everyone from very young people to very old people and he made us laugh at a time , in the communist period , when there were not many reasons to laugh . ''
The Isle of Man 's Chief Minister , Tony Brown MHK , said that he was `` deeply saddened '' to have heard of the death .
He is quoted as having said '' -LSB- w -RSB- e were very fortunate indeed that Sir Norman chose to make the Isle of Man his home .
He was a wonderful asset to the local community and made a tremendous contribution to countless Island charities and good causes . ''
He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in her conferred role as Lord of Mann on his 90th birthday in 2005 , at the same time being made a Freeman of the Borough of Douglas .
The announcement of Sir Norman 's death was confirmed by his son and family in a statement last night .

November 21 , 2010
Riots in the town of Salt in Jordan have ended .
The violence followed the shooting of a man at a police roadblock ; 34 have been arrested over the riots , as has the policeman who pulled the trigger .
25-year-old Suleiman Khreisat was shot in the head on Wednesday and remains in critical condition ; according to police , his car appeared suspicious , as it had no licence plates and broken windows .
A police major gave chase after Khreisat allegedly failed to stop and shot him ; he is now detained for use of excessive force against a civilian .
`` Salt residents wanted to know who shot their townsman , demanding that police identify him so that they could take revenge , '' added Lieutenant Colonel Mohammed al-Khatib .
Rioters attacked police kiosks , a traffic police building , and police cars .
Stones were thrown at officers .
Non-police targets included cash machines , streetlights , shop windows , cars and trees that were burned in two town squares .
Roadblocks of burning tyres were formed .
`` Several police officers and citizens were also wounded and have been hospitalized , '' according to al-Khatib , who added that tear gas was used to battle rioters .
He says all 34 arrested will face trial .

December 14 , 2010
An armed gunman took hostages and fired shots during a school board meeting in Panama City , Florida at the Bay District Schools ' Nelson Building Tuesday .
The gunman has been identified as Clay Duke , 56 , whose wife had been fired by the school district .
Duke fired at board members until he was shot and wounded by district security chief Mike Jones .
Shortly afterwards Duke shot himself in the head .
Only Duke was injured in the fray even though he shot at Superintendent Bill Husfelt and other board members at close range .
Duke opened fire , after rambling on about the firing of his wife and sales tax .
Husfelt pleaded with Duke to let the others go as he was responsible for his wifes firing , however Duke raised the gun and began to fire .
After firing on the board members , Duke was shot several times by former School Board member and district security chief Mike Jones .
Jones was not in the room at the time , and was alerted of the situation .
After being shot by Jones , Duke proceeded to place the gun to his head and shot himself .
Duke was pronounced dead shortly after at a local hospital and an autopsy is scheduled for Wednesday .
Jones , although not physically injured , was admitted to hospital for observation .
After the shooting Superintendent Husfelt admitted that he `` really did n't know what he -LSB- Duke -RSB- was talking about . ''
Husfelt believes that Duke used a combination of blanks and live rounds , however the police are adamant that Duke used only live rounds .
Panama City police chief , John Van Etten , described the gun as a small caliber handgun , however superintendent Husfelt said , `` It looked like a shotgun when it was pointed at me '' A spokesperson for the school board , Karen Tucker , described Duke as `` a large guy '' and reported that she had seen him sitting at the back of the room .
A member of the board , Ginger Littleton , along with the other women and children , were sent out of the room , however she returned to the room as she could not leave the others behind .
She tried to disarm Duke by hitting him with her heavy handbag , however it was not heavy enough as Duke knocked her down .
She said that he aimed `` directly at my -LSB- Littleton 's -RSB- brain '' , but he did not fire at her and she eventually escaped the room unharmed .
A SWAT team burst into the meeting room and were initially thought to have shot Duke , but it was later determined that Duke had shot himself , according to police .
The gunman was taken out of the meeting room on a stretcher .
Witness have said that shots were heard , however there are reports circulating that the gunman shot blanks instead of live rounds .
A reporter who was in the room at the time thinks the weapon may have been a `` cap gun '' , but police say that the weapon was a pistol loaded with live rounds .
The gunman allegedly spray painted the letter ` V ' on the meeting room wall .
The ` V ' is the same symbol used in the movie V for Vendetta .

filename:<doc id="253241" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=253241" title="BP lose laptop containing sensitive claimant data"><paragraph:1_2_4_6_7>:SNT_LIST
March 30 , 2011
Oil company BP has reportedly lost a laptop containing the personal information of approximately 13,000 people who filed claims against the company following the `` Deepwater Horizon '' disaster last year .
Tom Mueller , a spokesperson for the company , confirmed they had written to `` individuals impacted by this event to inform them about the loss of their personal data and to offer them free credit monitoring services to help protect their personal information . ''
Mueller said the laptop was lost during `` routine business travel , '' and was reported to have the ability to be deactivated remotely .
BP refused to comment about the employee who lost the laptop .
The data on the laptop contained the names , addresses , Social Security numbers , phone numbers and the dates of birth of claimants , which was unencrypted even though the laptop itself is protected by a password .
The data on the laptop concerned claimants against the company after one of its oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico exploded , sending up to 4.9 million barrels of oil into the ocean , which eventually reached the southern U.S. coastline .
One resident affected by the the oil disaster and the lost laptop expressed his outrage at BP when interviewed by NPR .
`` It 's terrible , I kinda work hard for the things I have , '' he said .
`` I would n't want somebody with a computer to be able to take it from me .
It 's very disturbing .
It 's like another gallon of gas thrown on the fire . ''

April 7 , 2011
At least fourteen people have died after eating toxic sardines in Madagascar .
The deaths occurred in the town of Toliara , with another similar situation happening 130 km -LRB- 80.8 mi -RRB- away in Sakaraha .
The sardines the victims ate belong to the Clupeidae family .
As well as the dead , around 120 people have been taken ill after eating the fish according to officials .
Dr Hery Raharisaina , Madagascar 's fishing and aquatic resources minister , offered condolence to the families of the victims on behalf of the government .
He added in his statement that the government would pay for the medical bills for those who are still hospitalized from the toxic fish and would also supply 100 mattresses to the city of Toliara , as the region 's hospital is overcrowded .
Samples of the sardines have been sent to health officials at the Institut Pasteur de Madagascar in the capital city of Antananarivo .
Incidents like this have happened before in which researchers have tracked the cause down to the fish eating poisonous seaweed .
Madagascar has the third biggest coral system in the world .

April 13 , 2011
On April 12 , 1961 , Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin lifted off on Vostok 1 , the first human spaceflight in history , completing one orbit of the Earth in just under two hours .
Tuesday marks the anniversary of Gagarin 's flight and fifty years of human space travel .
Celebrations were to take place all over the world and aboard the International Space Station .
Yuri 's Night , started in 2001 for fortieth anniversary celebrations , is a global celebration of the history of spaceflight , including the first Space Shuttle launch on April 12 , 1981 , the twentieth anniversary of Gagarin 's flight .
There were to be more than 400 events in 71 countries celebrating Yuri 's Night this year .
Gagarin 's flight lasted 108 minutes , just under two hours , and consisted of one full orbit around the Earth .
His trip to orbit came just four years after the launch of Sputnik 1 and the beginning of the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union -LRB- USSR -RRB- .
The crew on board the International Space Station -LRB- ISS -RRB- also marked the fiftieth anniversary by delivering a message from space .
While addressing viewers , station commander Dmitry Kondratyev referred to the portrait of Gagarin floating next to him as a representation of the achievement of `` humankind at large '' .
A movie , entitled First Orbit , was filmed in parts in space when the orbit of the ISS matched that of Gagarin 's flight .
The movie , produced by filmmaker Christopher Riley , was filmed by ESA astronaut Paolo Nespoli and matches the radio communications , times , and views of the flight .
The film is freely available to the public and made its debut on Tuesday to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the human race becoming a space-faring species .

April 30 , 2011
At least sixteen people are reported killed in a terrorist bombing in the city of Marrakech , Morocco .
The bombing occurred in the busy Argana café before lunch time , Thursday .
The café , located in the popular Jemaa el-Fnaa square , is within what is known as the old city .
The square , a UNESCO World Heritage site and one of the country 's top tourist attractions , draws many foreign visitors .
Early reports blamed a gas can catching fire .
Witness reports indicate the blast destroyed the entire second floor of the café , blasting off the terrace and roof demolishing the front of the building .
Photographer Tarek Bozid reported , `` Everything was covered in blood .
The scene was horrifying .
Tables were broken and glass was shattered . ''
Ten of the victims were foreign , including six French nationals and one Briton .
Half of the dead are reported to be women ; and , at least 20 other people were critically wounded including a number foreigners .
Two Swiss nationals , two Russians , two Tunisians and two Dutch tourists are reported to be amongst those injured .
Although the blast was at first considered an accident , the Interior Ministry confirmed it was an intentional act .
`` Analysis of the early evidence collected at the site of the blast confirms the theory of an attack , '' he said in a statement issued through the official Maghreb Arabe Presse -LRB- MAP -RRB- news agency .
Medics said nails , often used in suicide bombs , were found in the bodies of most victims .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy has expressed his outrage , considering it to be `` heinous , cruel and cowardly '' .
The act has been condemned by leaders internationally .
French foreign minister Alain Juppe stated he is unaware of any particular threat to France in Morroco , once a French protectorate .
This is the first major attack on Morocco since the 2003 Casablanca bombings , which killed 45 and injured more than 100 .

July 8 , 2011
Finnish cross-country skier Mika Myllylä , a six-time Olympic medalist , including one gold , has been found dead .
He was 41 .
Police said he was alone at his apartment in Kokkola and no crime is suspected .
His cause of death remains unclear .
Born 1969 in Oulu , Myllylä won Olympic silver at the 50 km cross-country race in Lillehammer , Norway in 1994 , and gold at the 30 km cross-country race in Nagano , Japan in 1998 .
These two Games netted him four bronze medals .
The 1999 World Championship in Austria saw him win three gold medals and one silver .
This and other World Championships saw him gain a total of nine World Championship medals .
It was at the 2001 World Championships in his native Finland that things went wrong for Myllylä .
A Finnish Ski Association bag was accidentally left at a petrol station close to Helsinki 's International Airport ; it was handed in to police , who discovered needles , infusion bags and a prescription for banned drug Hemohes -LRB- HES -RRB- signed off by a team doctor .
HES had been banned the previous year by the International Olympic Committee because it reduced hemoglobin concentration and oxygen-carrying red blood cell counts ; this allowed it to mask the presence of banned drug erythropoietin -LRB- EPO -RRB- , which raises red blood cell production .
Last year Myllylä provided a court with a sworn statement confirming he had used EPO in the decade preceding the controversy .
Myllylä and five other Finnish skiers tested positive for HES in what became a national scandal ; the Finnish Ski Association 's president , and the team 's doctors and coaches left or were sacked .
Myllylä was handed a two-year sporting ban , after which he returned to competitive skiing ; although he twice won the national championships , he gave up in 2005 .
These events changed Myllylä , according to longtime friend and national cross-country skiing association chair Reijo Alakoski .
`` He should be remembered as a great athlete ... Mika changed completely as a person on the day his doping was made public .
It has been sad to watch his descent and anguish from the sidelines over the last ten years . ''
His passing `` is a dark day in the history of Ostrobothnian cross-country skiing , '' said Alakoski .
Since then his personal life has been difficult .
Drink-driving convictions came in 2008 and 2010 as Myllylä fought alcoholism , and he was thrice convicted of assault .
He and his wife Suvi were divorced in 2007 .
`` A champion has passed into eternity , '' according to ex-Finnish Ski Association CEO Jari Piirainen .
`` Although Mika will of course be remembered for his sporting achievements , we should of course remember that he was also a father . ''
Piirainen also reflected on media attention towards Myllylä : `` Maybe it 's just ... how much pressure we put on our idols and sportsmen .
And how do we deal with them when they are at the top -- do we accept that people are people and accept that everyone makes mistakes , and forgive them ? ''
Piirainen himself was caught up in the doping scandal after a news story into Finnish doping led to a libel case .
Piirainen 's statements in court led to him facing a fraud trial , but he was cleared .
`` My heart is broken , '' Myllylä said when his doping was exposed `` and there is no way to describe the amount of my agony with words .
I kneel down , admit my defeat and beg for peace for my soul . ''
The then-culture minister , Suvi Linden , said at the time `` Everyone who felt joy at the success of the team now feels betrayed . ''
Myllylä fathered three children , whom he is survived by .

filename:<doc id="271762" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=271762" title="Euro reaches new lows"><paragraph:1_2_6_10>:SNT_LIST
July 15 , 2011
On Tuesday , the Euro fell to a new record low in relation to the Swiss Franc , and to multi-month lows against the U.S. Dollar and Japanese yen ; all considered by investors to be safe currencies during times of economic turmoil .
The Wall Street Journal reported earlier that recent comments from the newly installed head of the International Monetary Fund , France 's Christine Lagarde , resulted in a sell-off of the Euro .
At a roundtable discussion in Washington , Lagarde noted that the IMF had not yet reached discussion of terms and conditions of a second Greek bailout plan .
In fact , a representative from the IMF is currently meeting with Eurozone policymakers to draft such a new proposal .
The yield differential between Italian bonds and German bonds has spread to more than 300 basis points , something not seen in over a decade and evidence of investors ' concern .
Adding to the Euro 's woes is the upcoming release of the bank stress tests on Friday .
The European Bankers Association said that they expect the data release to shed new light on the Eurozone 's banking situation .
Representatives of several of the Eurozone 's governments , including Germany , have requested that the association consider releasing fewer specific details for fear that investor panic will ensue .
The inadequacy of the capitalization rates has been an issue with the European Central Bank , whose president recently called upon Eurozone banks to make every effort to put their balance sheets in order .
For the time being at least , an unsubstantiated rumor reported by the `` Wall Street Journal '' states that the Eurozone 's central banks ' purchase of periphery debt has helped to quell the downward momentum of the Euro .

August 5 , 2011
More than two years after Air France Flight 447 crashed into the Atlantic , killing 228 , a French pilots union , a group supporting victims ' families , and Air France have all criticised the ongoing investigation .
The Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses -LRB- BEA -RRB- is being accused of trying to blame the pilots in order to absolve Airbus .
The controversy follows the release of the BEA 's latest interim report detailing findings so far .
At the last moment , the BEA removed a recommendation added by chief investigator Alain Bouillard which called for alarms on Airbus A330s to be modified .
The National Airline Pilots Union -LRB- SNPL -RRB- is concerned the investigation is degenerating `` into a simple charge sheet against the crew , '' and says the latest revelations left them with `` seriously damaged '' faith in the investigators .
The SNPL has withdrawn all support in the probe .
Air France claim alarms on the A330-200 were `` misleading '' and contributed to the disaster .
Robert Soulas , president of French victims ' families group Entraide et Solidarité AF447 , claims the move proves bias in the BEA .
The dispute surrounds stall warning systems .
An aircraft stalls if it no longer has sufficient speed to keep itself airbourne .
The warnings cut out at extremely low speeds , meaning if a stall progresses far enough the warning can cease .
The correct course of action in a stall is to lower the nose , increasing an aircraft 's speed ; if the speed increases , the warnings can sound again .
This may confuse pilots into abandoning corrective measures .
The BEA have responded that the last-minute call to remove a recommendation calling for changes to stall warning design was owing to a need to examine the issue further .
They say behavioral psychologists and cockpit designers have been teamed up to look into the warnings and how crews respond to them .
The BEA intends to make a recommendation on the issue in the future , and a spokesperson expressed `` deep regret '' at the SNPL 's response .
Friday 's 117-page report did examine the actions and training of the pilots .
The report says they were untrained in high-altitude manual flying and in how to identify and react to failures of speed sensors .
Neither was a standard part of training at the time .
The speed sensing system failed , causing the autopilot and autothrust to switch off .
This was followed by stall warnings , which the interim BEA report say were ignored by pilots during a three-and-a-half minute fall of 38,000 feet into the ocean .
`` The haste with which these authorities and these officials accused the pilots without any forethought aroused our suspicions , '' said Soulas .
`` We now have confirmation that the affirmations coming from the BEA were not only premature , -LRB- but -RRB- lacking any objectivity , partial and very oriented towards the defence of Airbus . ''
For weeks his organisation has mounted protests against the direction taken by the investigation .
Air France , who are battling legally with Airbus over responsibility -LRB- both firms are also under criminal investigation -RRB- , wrote to the European Aviation Safety Agency asking that they examine the stall warnings and seek that they be changed in need be .
Air France previously upgraded the speed sensors on their A330s .
Junior Transport Minister Thierry Mariani defended the BEA .
`` There has never been such a transparent enquiry : it was filmed , took place under the judiciary 's control , with Brazilian -LSB- and -RSB- American investigators .
These controversies discredit an enquiry that is exemplary . ''
Airbus also responded .
`` Can you imagine for an instant that , because of economic interests or links between the BEA and Airbus , we 'd put in peril all the other airlines operating this plane ?
It 's neither conceivable nor admissible , '' said a statement .
About 180 airlines use the Airbus A330 .

August 15 , 2011
At least nineteen people have been killed in two days of attacks by the Syrian Navy and ground forces on the northern port city of Latakia , say human rights activists .
The crackdown in the city began on Saturday , a day after several thousand people staged protests against the government .
An estimated twenty tanks and other armored vehicles , as well as at least two navy vessels , were reported to be firing on the city .
A witness told Reuters that they can `` see the silhouettes of two grey vessels .
They are firing their guns and the impact is landing on al-Ramleh , al-Filistini and al-Shaab neighbourhoods . ''
According to state television , however , there has not been any weapons fire from navy ships , and the government has previously stated it is moving only against terrorists and others who are responsible for instigating dissent among Syrian citizens .
The total death toll is unclear , with at least two and as many as five people reported dead on Saturday and estimates of the death toll on Sunday ranging from at least nineteen , according to the BBC , to at least 25 , according to Al Jazeera .

filename:<doc id="277694" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=277694" title="Scots report crime using Facebook"><paragraph:1_2_4_6_7_9>:SNT_LIST
August 18 , 2011
Facebook has revealed a new system in conjunction with the Scottish Lothian and Borders Police whereby users can report criminal activity and concerns to police using the social networking site .
The `` Made From Crime '' initiative allows Internet users to anonymously report their concerns to police on a dedicated Facebook page that is being established to direct people with tip-offs to Crimestoppers .
Police will also be able to send mass Bluetooth messages to mobile phones at public events like football matches to encourage the public to report crime .
Designed to make use of the Proceeds of Crime Act , it will be the first of its kind in Scotland with the Scottish government , the Crown Office , and Procurator Services constituting the foundation of the service .
Their backing will allow officers to seize assets that have been purchased through criminal activity .
Assistant Chief Constable Iain Livingstone of Lothian and Borders Police has stated to the public : `` We know there are people living beyond their means on the proceeds of crime , be it through the purchase of flash cars , designer clothes or expensive jewellery , and that communities are suffering from the side effects of drug dealing , violence and other associated crimes '' .
Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill states that Lothian and Borders Police is tackling the problem of dirty money that has been obtained through criminal activity in a serious matter .
Constable Livingstone has encouraged this , appealing to local communities to provide information and come forth immediately either to Crimestoppers or the Lothian and Borders Police .
Solicitor General Lesley Thomson QC has affirmed that they will take a robust approach to those that profit from crime , using the vast powers at their disposal though the Proceeds of Crime Act.The act has resulted in more than £ 41 million -LRB- US$ 67.09 million , € 46.66 million -RRB- in seizures from crooks .
It has been utilised in new community projects in Edinburgh , the Lothians and throughout Scotland .

January 22 , 2012
Indian Member of Parliament Asaduddin Owaisi is demanding the arrest of writers who read excerpts from banned novel The Satanic Verses at the Jaipur Literature Festival .
`` Reading from a banned book is a deliberate provocation and proof that the festival is a forum for Islam-bashing , '' Owaisi said .
Rushdie was due to attend the festival but backed out , alleging death threats from the Mumbai underworld .
British writer Hari Kunzru and many others read short passages from the book to support Rushdie despite efforts to stop them .
Kunzru said on Twitter he sought `` to defy bigots '' .
Owaisi wants police to act under sections 153 A and 295 A of the Indian Penal code , which deal with religious matters .
Organisers of the event said they had no idea that Kunzru and others would act as they did .
They added that any illegal action at the festival would not be entertained .
`` The Satanic Verses '' is controversial and is condemned by the Islamic community .
Rushdie lived in hiding for years following the then Iranian spiritual leader , Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , calling for his death soon after the book 's publication .

January 22 , 2012
A posting yesterday on the social networking web site Twitter by the Pennsylvania State University 's student blog Onward State , which incorrectly reported the death of former Penn State football coach Joe Paterno , has led to the resignation of one of its managing editors .
Paterno died today .
Paterno had been hospitalized over the weekend due to complications from lung cancer , and was in serious condition .
The Onward State blog had picked up word of his death at the age of 85 , which was then posted on Twitter at 8:45 PM EST. .
Various news organizations began to pick up the story after word of the report had been picked up by CBS .
Penn State students held a candlelight vigil in front of a statue of Paterno on campus after word of the erroneous passing .
However , CBS soon retracted the story after posts from other Paterno family members on Twitter reported that Joe had not died .
At 10:20 PM EST , the managing editor for Onward State , Devon Edwards , officially retracted the story , saying in another tweet ; `` Our 8:45 pm tweet about Joe Paterno 's death appears to be inaccurate , according to @JayPaterno , who says he 's alive .
We were confident when we ran with it , and are still trying to figure out where our process failed .
We apologize sincerely for error . ''
Additionally , Edwards also announced that he would be resigning from his position at Onward State , effective immediately .
In a blog post officially announcing his resignation , Edwards explained that `` In this day and age , getting it first often conflicts with getting it right , but our intention was never to fall into that chasm .
All I can do now is promise that in the future , we will exercise caution , restraint , and humility . ''
This morning , a report officially confirmed that Joe Paterno had died -- today -- from lung cancer at the age of 85 .

filename:<doc id="364066" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=364066" title="Opposition calls for mass protests in Bahrain"><paragraph:1_3_6_7_11_14_17_21>:SNT_LIST
February 15 , 2012
In Bahrain , tension is building between the opposition protesters who want to revive last year 's marches , and government authorities who are trying to maintain control over protest activities .
A planned march by the February 14 Youth Coalition to Manama 's former Pearl Roundabout , to mark the beginning of last year 's protests , was overwhelmed by the security surrounding the site on the eve of the anniversary as well as the day itself .
Since the Bahraini uprising in 2011 , the roundabout became a touchstone of opposition .
Authorities responded by clearing the site and renaming it al-Farouq Junction .
Whilst initially blocked to traffic to prevent any more protests , Bahrain 's police now occupy the area and are demonstrably equipped to repel opposition .
With activists and political parties called for mass protests a few days prior to the one-year anniversary , the government now says it may bring charges against organizers for encouraging the disorder .
Nabeel Rajab , a prominent human rights activist in Bahrain , announced his intention to take part in marches to the Pearl Roundabout .
He led several hundred pro-democracy activists in Manama 's old market area before suddenly marching towards the Pearl Roundabout .
The protest ended a few hundred meters away from the roundabout with police firing tear gas and stun grenades after using megaphones to warn protesters the march was unauthorised and they should disperse .
Two women from US-based rights group `` Witness Bahrain '' taking part in Sunday 's march were arrested and deported .
Five opposition political groups headed by Al Wefaq , Bahrain 's largest political opposition party , organized an authorized sit-in in a yard , dubbed ` Freedom Square ' , in Al Muqsha village outside of Manama .
This is the same location as the opposition 's week-long ` sit-in ' for political reforms .
At that sit-in last week , Ayat al-Qormozi , a Bahraini female poet and visible leader in the opposition movement , called for the crowd in Al Muqsha to march to the symbolic roundabout and chanted , `` We will return .
We will return . ''
Most clashes between police and protesters occurred in the Shia neighborhoods .
About 70 percent of Bahrainis are Shia and they form the base of the youth activists and Al-Wefaq protesters .
The Sunnis have organized counter-demonstrations in support of the ruling Al Khalifa family .
They control the government 's cabinet , and are also Sunni .
The formation of the cabinet is one of the key debates between the opposition Al Wefaq and the Sunni minority in country .
Al Wefaq wants elected politicians to name the cabinet , whilst the Sunnis prefer the royal family to retain that power .
In an interview with Der Spiegel , King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa denied that there was an opposition in his country similar to those in Western nations but accepted that there are `` people with different views . ''

February 20 , 2012
British Foreign Secretary William Hague has described a possibility of a new cold war in the Middle East due to the Iranian nuclear programme .
United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon suggests negotiating with Iran by asking it to disprove the allegations of developing nuclear weapons .
`` If -LSB- the Iranians -RSB- obtain nuclear weapons capability , then I think other nations across the Middle East will want to develop nuclear weapons , '' Hague said .
`` The most serious round of nuclear proliferation since nuclear weapons were invented would have begun . ''
Ex-UK diplomat Sir Richard Dalton rules out the possibility of Iran developing nuclear weapons .
Meanwhile Ki-moon dismissed US and Israeli suggestions of attacking Iran , saying that `` all these issues should be resolved peacefully through negotiations , through dialogue . ''
He said so after attending anniversary ceremonies of an agency to detect secret nuclear weapon tests , called the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organisation .
Hague has also urged Israel not to strike .
He said , `` All options must remain on the table but a military attack would have enormous downsides . ''
He insisted on giving sanctions to Iran instead .
However , some US officials extrapolated that Iran is determined about the nuclear programme as the nation threatened to disrupt oil supply to six European nations earlier this week .
A number of US officials now believe that attacking Iran is the only way out .
Dalton stated , `` There are many signs , as reported by the International Atomic Energy Agency , that some research and development relevant to the development of nuclear weapons may still be going on .
But it is wrong to say that Iran is rushing towards having a nuclear weapon . ''
Iran organised a ceremony which revealed its nuclear programme on Wednesday .
It stated that the programme is only about generating nuclear power .
Iran also loaded its first domestically created fuel into the reactor last week .

May 9 , 2012
Yevgenia Tymoshenko has announced her mother , former Ukrainian Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko , is to end her hunger strike after nineteen days .
Yulia 's lawyer , Serhiy Vlasenko , cited `` what is happening in the country and what is happening to her in prison '' as reasons for her commencing her fast .
The politician is serving a seven-year sentence for abuse of office arising from a gas deal with Russia while she was Prime Minister .
She has accused jail guards of assaulting her while transporting her to a hospital against her will to get treatment for back pain which she has reportedly been experiencing for months .
In the incident , Vlasenko said Tymoshenko `` naturally got scared , began resisting , after which she received a punch in the stomach and passed out '' , referring to a bruise which remains present on her body .
Adherents of Tymoshenko have publicised pictures showing bruising on the politician 's body .
Corrections officers have refuted claims of their responsibility .
Kharkiv regional prosecutor , Henadiy Tyurin , confirmed `` she was picked up , carried to the car and taken to the hospital '' but insisted : `` According to the law ... the prison service has the right to use physical measures '' .
Tymoshenko was scheduled to appear in a fresh trial for a tax evasion charge the day before she was taken to hospital .
In theory , the hearing could have her imprisonment extended to the year 2023 .
The trial has been postponed to May 21 .
She does not accept she broke the law as the boss of a Ukrainian gas company in the 1990s .
Tymoshenko has refused to accept medical treatment from Ukrainian doctors for her back problems , but has been given permission to travel from her current prison in Kharkiv to a hospital in the same city yesterday .
There she is to be assisted by German doctor Lutz Harms , who is to `` begin bringing -LSB- her -RSB- out of her hunger strike '' , Yevgenia explained .
At the time of her going on hunger strike , Vlasenko spoke of Tymoshenko not having the ability to leave her own bed .
Yevgenia described how her mother `` appears to have lost 10 kg -LSB- 22 lbs -RSB- , her temperature has dropped significantly and she may pass out any minute now '' .
Due to the hunger strike , it was considered `` impossible to start treatment immediately '' , she said .
In the hours prior to this announcement , the Ukrainian government postponed a European summit scheduled for May 11 -- 12 in the city of Yalta due to what the country 's Ministry of Foreign Affairs described as a `` connection with the fact that a number of European leaders -LSB- being -RSB- unable to take part in the Yalta summit for different reasons '' .
At least ten leaders , including the presidents of the Czech Republic , Romania , Austria and Germany , reportedly reversed their decisions to appear at the summit in relation to the treatment of Tymoshenko .
Ukrainian UEFA Euro 2012 football matches scheduled for June may also be boycotted by leaders , according to BBC News Online .
The European Commission has stated its commissioners will refuse to attend Ukraine-hosted Euro 2012 matches .
The German government has clarified that what happens to Tymoshenko will influence whether or not its representatives will appear at the matches .
Tymoshenko denies abuse of office charges , believing them to be part of a campaign by President Viktor Yanukovych to prohibit her from politics .
The European Union and the United States strongly criticised the conviction as they believed it is politically influenced .
In the 2010 presidential elections , she was narrowly beaten by Yanukovych .
Tymoshenko was also the leader of the Orange Revolution , which removed power from Yanukovych after he won the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election amid electoral fraud .
In a letter , Tymoshenko appealed to Europe to persist in pressuring Yanukovych because Ukrainian citizens `` can not fight -LSB- Yanukovych 's government -RSB- on their own '' and `` Ukraine may simply never have fair elections again '' , she claimed .
She had earlier spoke of her belief that Yanukovych was vengeful .

filename:<doc id="1159073" url="https://en.wikinews.org/wiki?curid=1159073" title="Scottish Justice Secretary 'acutely aware of unusual publicity' in Kular case"><paragraph:1_3_6_9_14_17_22_26_28_31>:SNT_LIST
February 13 , 2014
Wikinews has obtained a letter by Scottish Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill to former Conservative justice spokesman John Lamont in response to questions raised by our correspondent about the Mikaeel Kular murder case .
`` Wikinews '' has investigated possible contempt by media publishing potentially prejudicial material , and MacAskill wrote he has `` been following the case of Mikaeel Kular and -LSB- is -RSB- acutely aware of the unusual publicity this case has attracted . ''
When Mikaeel Kular , three , vanished from his Edinburgh home last month police and volunteers scoured the capital for him .
His body was found in Fife just before midnight on January 17 , and his mother was arrested on January 18 .
That 's when `` Wikinews '' first reported on possible widespread contempt by UK and Scottish media .
Our correspondent is based in Scotland and has been advised by a lawyer not to identify anybody detained until they have appeared in court , even if they have been arrested and charged .
Professor James Chalmers of the University of Glasgow has since reviewed our coverage and confirmed this position .
Despite that a large number of major media outlets identified Rosdeep Adekoya , nee Kular , 33 , as the arrested individual .
Adekoya has since been in Edinburgh Sheriff Court charged with murdering her son .
She is in custody pending indictment and trial , but any eyewitness evidence may be tainted because her image has been widely published .
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK but Scottish justice works differently and courts have viewed publication of photos as potentially prejudicial .
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes `` journalists do seem to be walking a dangerous line if publishing photos etc of suspects . ''
Crown Office , which is in overall charge of prosecutions , has indicated to journalists that no further comment will be made at least until indictment .
MacAskill however expressed confidence in the Scottish court system to deal with the situation .
`` I am confident ... the courts themselves will intervene if they believe publicity is in danger of being prejudicial . ''
He also wrote to Lamont that he has faith in the court to successfully direct any jury that may try the case in order to maintain fairness .
The Contempt of Court Act 1981 is designed to prevent prejudicial material going in front of juries before trial .
Although UK-wide legislation , the law is interpreted differently north of the border than in England and Wales .
Witnesses in Scotland may be asked to identify accused persons standing in the dock .
The BBC College of Journalism advises legal advice be sought ahead of publishing photos and notes it has previously been ruled contempt .
The BBC used the accused 's photo prominently in their own online coverage .
Chalmers explains : `` It may be a contempt of court to create a substantial risk of serious prejudice to someone 's right to a fair trial .
A photograph might do this in a case where identification is an issue ; on the face of it , that does not seem especially likely in this case , but it is impossible to know for certain at this point .
The courts have said that the only safe route to avoid committing a contempt is to avoid publishing a photograph , but that does not mean that publishing a photograph is automatically a contempt . ''
MacAskill noted `` the kind of issue that publicity might raise may become apparent only during the trial itself . ''
Contempt has been a considerable issue in the UK in recent years after high-profile cases .
In one instance a charge against serial killer Levi Bellfield was dropped owing to publicity while the jury were deliberating ; in another , newspapers were fined and sued for libel over reporting on the arrest of a suspect who turned out to be innocent in a prominent investigation .
A proposal was mooted to ban identification of suspects arrested anywhere in the UK , but this was subsequently shelved .
MacAskill confirmed `` the Scottish Government is content with the way the courts are operating the rules on contempt of court in Scotland at the moment and has no plans to make changes . ''
He also wrote of the difficulties with trying to individually cover all eventualities with prescriptive legislation , saying `` A trial for a sexual offence will raise very different issues -- particularly of protecting victims -- from those that are raised by a tax fraud trial . ''
MacAskill says it is the Scottish Government 's position that the task of `` counterbalancing the public interest in reporting with upholding the criminal law should be left to those whose job it is to do so -- the courts and the judiciary , acting in the individual circumstances of the case '' .

May 26 , 2017
On Wednesday , in the UEFA Europa League final , Manchester United defeated Dutch capital-club Ajax AFC 0 -- 2 to win the Europa League title and qualify for the UEFA Champions League group stage despite finishing sixth in the Premier League this season .
A deflected goal from Paul Pogba 's left-footed shot in the first half and a flick goal by Henrikh Mkhitaryan in the second half ensured that José Mourinho 's side lifts its third trophy in this season , previously winning Community Shield and the EFL Cup .
Before the kick-off , a one-minute silence was observed at the Friends Arena , Stockholm , for the victims of a suicide attack in Manchester Arena on Monday .
The English side had just 33 % ball possession in the entire match , completing 192 passes out of 276 .
A comparatively young Ajax team , with the average age of the starting lineup no more than 23 years , had 88 % passing accuracy , with 565 successful passes .
Manchester United had better numbers for defense , recovering 64 balls -- 22 more than Ajax , and had almost twice as many ball clearances as the Dutch counterpart .
A total of 32 fouls were committed in the match , and the official booked six players -- three players of each side received a yellow card .
At the age of 17 years and 285 days , Ajax 's Matthijs de Ligt became the youngest player to play in the Europa League final , while Marcus Rashford became the youngest winner of the tournament at the age of 19 years and 205 days .
A deflection off Davinson Sánchez from Paul Pogba 's left-footed shot gave United an early lead .
Ajax 's shot-stopper saved Antonio Valencia 's close-range strike .
Another attempt in the first half by Ajax 's Bertrand Traoré was saved by Sergio Romero .
The half time ended 0 -- 1 .
Minutes into the second half , Armenian midfielder Mkhitaryan scored a goal just in front of Ajax 's net , which doubled Manchester 's lead .
Five players were booked in the second half .
Ajax 's attempts in the final minutes of the game were stopped by Romero , not giving them a chance to reduce the difference .
Last season , Premier League club Liverpool FC lost the Europa finals against Spanish side Sevilla FC .
United is the first English club to win the Europa since 2013 .
This season 's Premier League winners Chelsea won the tournament four years ago against Benfica at Ajax 's ground , Amsterdam ArenA .
Since then , Sevilla has added three Europa titles to their collection .
After the match , Ajax 's coach Peter Bosz said , `` We 're obviously disappointed .
I did n't see the Ajax team I 'm used to , pressing and competing for first balls .
We were n't good enough .
Often , to win finals you must first lose them .
It 's all new for all my team .
They will learn a lot from it and if we keep the squad together they will be stronger for it . ''
Bosz 's first season as Ajax 's coach ended trophy-less .
Manchester United 's boss José Mourinho said , `` We are in the Champions League in the right way and for me the right way is winning the Premier League or winning the Europa League .
We were not strong enough to win the Premier League but we were strong enough to win the Europa League and we are back in the Champions League .
The club now has every trophy in world football .
We fought hard for this since the beginning .
We totally deserved the win .
I am so happy to see all the players , including the boys with the crutches , with the trophy . ''
The Portuguese has won two Champions League titles -- one each with FC Porto and Inter , and two Europa titles -- the first one with Porto .
United became the fifth team after Bayern Munich , Chelsea , Juventus , and Ajax to win all three major UEFA trophies -- European Cup Winners ' Cup , the European Cup -LRB- rebranded as Champions League -RRB- and UEFA Cup -LRB- rebranded as Europa League -RRB- .
They are to face the winner of Real Madrid and Juventus in the Champions League final in the UEFA Super Cup scheduled on August 8 at the Philip II Arena in Skopje .

May 27 , 2018
On Thursday , Pakistan 's lower house of parliament , the National Assembly , voted in favour of merging the country 's Federally Administered Tribal Areas -LRB- FATA -RRB- with the neighbouring province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa -LRB- KP -RRB- .
The bill , subject to approval by the Senate , the KP assembly , and the president , would ensure FATA is governed by the federal as well as the provincial government .
The Senate passed the bill on Friday by a two-thirds majority , with 71 voting in favour and five opposing the merger .
The bill was passed by a 229 to 1 majority by the 342-member National Assembly in Islamabad .
Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi thanked the opposition parties for their support .
The Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party and Jamiat Ulema-e Islam -LRB- F -RRB- -LRB- JUI-F -RRB- were the only two parties to oppose the merger .
Opposition leader Imran Khan of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf -LRB- PTI -RRB- political party said , `` The tribal people want immediate justice just like the system that we have in KP '' .
Since Pakistan 's 1947 independence from British rule , FATA has been governed by `` Political Agents '' appointed by the Pakistani President .
These agents exercise near-complete autonomous control over the area .
About five million people live in the seven districts -- Bajaur , Khyber , Kurram , Mohmand , Orakzai as well as North and South Waziristan -- which constitute FATA .
Political agents are responsible for providing governmental services and judiciary under Article 247 of the Pakistani Constitution .
Before January 12 , when a bill extended to FATA the writ of the Pakistani Supreme Court and Peshawar High Court , the tribal area was out of the jurisdiction of the Pakistani courts .
Collective punishment of a tribe can be declared under the Frontier Crimes Regulations , the code applicable to the seven districts .
Per the rules dating back to the colonial era , FATA citizens do not enjoy all the rights under the Constitution of Pakistan that other Pakistanis are entitled to .
Prime Minister Abbasi said , `` This is the start of a process , not the end of one .
We need to gain the trust of the people of FATA , and that trust will not come just through words '' .
He later added , `` We have to give the people of FATA the same schools , the same colleges , the same universities , the same hospitals , the same roads and the system as is available to everyone else in Pakistan .
There should be no difference there . ''
If the bill is passed , it is expected to change the first article of the Pakistani Constitution , which defines the territory of Pakistan , listing FATA separately from the other provinces .
Article 246 , which defines the Federally Administered Tribal Areas , would be modified and Article 247 , which gives the guidelines to administer all the tribal areas including FATA , is expected to be removed once the merger bill is approved .
The bill grants FATA citizens the right to elect their representatives in national and provincial assemblies .
The bill states the National Assembly seats are to be reduced from 342 to 336 ; the Senate is to be reduced from 104 to 96 seats .
The change of the number of seats in both the houses of parliament occurs in Articles 51 and 59 of the Constitution which direct the number of seats available for those houses .
The bill also says FATA is to hold 21 seats in the Pakhtunkhwa Provincial Assembly .
Militant groups Pakistani Taliban and al Qaeda have operated in FATA for years , and military actions were carried out since 2008 to usurp militant groups ' control over the area and restore Pakistani control .
Muttahida Qaumi Movement party leader Dr Farooq Sattar called for a referendum to make FATA a separate province and explained their support for the current bill as `` for the sake of political unity '' .
`` We fear that if Fata is merged with KP , it will get difficult to create a new province in the future '' , Sattar commented .
Calling it a `` black day '' , JUI-F 's representative Jamaluddin said the parties had voted to `` usurp the rights of the people of Fata '' .
Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi said , `` Today this house has approved a historic bill , which will have very positive effects for Pakistan . ''
The merger bill needs to be approved by at least two thirds of the members of KP 's assembly .
Per Article 239 -LRB- 4 -RRB- of the constitution , any bill which may lead to constitutional amendment and alter provincial boundaries requires at least a two-thirds majority from the provincial assembly before it is presented to the President .

When you beat Brazil and get into the semi-final , the focus has to be to try to win the World Cup .
But you need to be realistic when you finish the tournament and look back .
These players made history back in Belgium and that 's all that matters .
These players deserve to have that accolade . ''
English coach Gareth Southgate said , `` In the end we are very proud of what we 've done .
We 're under no illusions as to where we stand as a team ; we 've finished in the final four but we 're not a top-four team yet , we know that and we 've never hidden behind that .
Against the very best teams we 've come up short but we 've had a wonderful adventure and some experiences that will stand this group of players and staff in really good stead for the future .
I could n't ask any more of any of the players today or right the way through the seven weeks we 've worked together . ''
Hazard won the Budweiser Man of the Match award .
